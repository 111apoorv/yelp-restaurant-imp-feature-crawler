My friend and I could not walk side by side most of the way without bumping into people walking in the other direction. Then I wondered where the tree roots were going to go and how much of a maintenance nightmare it must and/or will be and wondered if, someday, it will fall into disrepair for that reason and eventually become the wonderful, abandoned, elevated train tracks it once was.I read budget was responsible for the narrowing of the path and the less interesting plantings on the stretch above 18th street but, I suspect ego might have also stood in the way of practicality in terms of design. In order to stay on budget, it might not have been a bad idea to sacrifice the plantings for a wider path since it seems the main objective was to be an elevated walkway.After baking in the hot sun with no chance of finding shade we exited at 18th street.

Taste like All-You-Can Buffet sushi4. Waitresses have bad English and bad service. One of them kept avoiding my question when I asked her if the noodle in the Ramen is instant noodle. When we asked her to get the manager over, she rudely told us that the manager would give the same answer. WOW.When we were leaving, we saw a long line waiting. Wish I had a megaphone so I could tell them it is not worth the wait unless you never tried authentic Japanese/Asian cuisine.In summary, if you have money to burn and standard for food, go somewhere else.", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 143}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "3", "Review ": "I will Never Ever Ever return to this place!

Low and behold, as I near the bottom of my bed of rice, I found that little bugger--literally and figuratively.I immediately stopped eating at the sight of it, and knew right then that no mushroom in the world could be hard-shelled or have tiny little legs, unless scientists have begun to splice mushrooms with bugs. Please let me know.After further examination with my chopsticks (meaning, I poked at the damn thing), the bug, brittle and all, split into two.

I asked for a black tea, specifically English breakfast... the new manager ignored this request and gave me a Lipton tea because... idk I guess my money ain&#39;t green enough. If you are going to charge 12 dollars for a sausage, egg, and cheese and small cup of tea please don`t screw up something so simple. No one said thank you. I had to impose/ask that my order be taken, not &#34;hi can I get you something&#34;. Thje manager who was on the floor, didn`t offer a greeting even though it was 7:45 am and not yet busy. Waiting to pay I got cut off by some other customer and despite there being 10-11 employees behind the counter no one preserved any semblance of order.I guess the store has decided that they have become too popular to maintain the same standards of service they once provided. There are a few employees who have been there since the beginning and are the saving grace of the entire experience. However based on the incompetence of the new manager, one would be better off going a block away to Murray`s bagels (whose products taste better and whose service is friendlier), or the other coffee shop on 26th and 8th street (which has a much larger seating area, better tasting and organic, and again has friendlier service)... This is if you are willing to spend the absurd amount of money this store is asking for sub-par service.The store itself is located next to a pet grooming shop (I`ll let that sink in... food preparation / pet grooming) and also a rather seedy bodega. Frankly, it would be cheaper to go into the bodega for a Lipton tea and breakfast sandwich. There is an incredible doughnut shop on 23rd between 7th and 8th... The other higher quality/friendlier options in the area are endless. When people say this establishment has the &#34;most amazing bagels&#34;, I am reminded (having lived in Chelsea my entire life) that is a constant stream of people who are new to the area and haven`t tried some of the other incredible offerings in the area... case in point Sullivan Street Bakery (a block away on 25th and 9th). I chanced it and went in after writing it off since the rude and incompetent new manager took it over; and am reminded why it`s better to spend your money elsewhere.

I asked for a black tea, specifically English breakfast... the new manager ignored this request and gave me a Lipton tea because... idk I guess my money ain&#39;t green enough. If you are going to charge 12 dollars for a sausage, egg, and cheese and small cup of tea please don`t screw up something so simple. No one said thank you. I had to impose/ask that my order be taken, not &#34;hi can I get you something&#34;. Thje manager who was on the floor, didn`t offer a greeting even though it was 7:45 am and not yet busy. Waiting to pay I got cut off by some other customer and despite there being 10-11 employees behind the counter no one preserved any semblance of order.I guess the store has decided that they have become too popular to maintain the same standards of service they once provided. There are a few employees who have been there since the beginning and are the saving grace of the entire experience. However based on the incompetence of the new manager, one would be better off going a block away to Murray`s bagels (whose products taste better and whose service is friendlier), or the other coffee shop on 26th and 8th street (which has a much larger seating area, better tasting and organic, and again has friendlier service)... This is if you are willing to spend the absurd amount of money this store is asking for sub-par service.The store itself is located next to a pet grooming shop (I`ll let that sink in... food preparation / pet grooming) and also a rather seedy bodega. Frankly, it would be cheaper to go into the bodega for a Lipton tea and breakfast sandwich. There is an incredible doughnut shop on 23rd between 7th and 8th... The other higher quality/friendlier options in the area are endless. When people say this establishment has the &#34;most amazing bagels&#34;, I am reminded (having lived in Chelsea my entire life) that is a constant stream of people who are new to the area and haven`t tried some of the other incredible offerings in the area... case in point Sullivan Street Bakery (a block away on 25th and 9th). I chanced it and went in after writing it off since the rude and incompetent new manager took it over; and am reminded why it`s better to spend your money elsewhere.

I asked for a black tea, specifically English breakfast... the new manager ignored this request and gave me a Lipton tea because... idk I guess my money ain&#39;t green enough. If you are going to charge 12 dollars for a sausage, egg, and cheese and small cup of tea please don`t screw up something so simple. No one said thank you. I had to impose/ask that my order be taken, not &#34;hi can I get you something&#34;. Thje manager who was on the floor, didn`t offer a greeting even though it was 7:45 am and not yet busy. Waiting to pay I got cut off by some other customer and despite there being 10-11 employees behind the counter no one preserved any semblance of order.I guess the store has decided that they have become too popular to maintain the same standards of service they once provided. There are a few employees who have been there since the beginning and are the saving grace of the entire experience. However based on the incompetence of the new manager, one would be better off going a block away to Murray`s bagels (whose products taste better and whose service is friendlier), or the other coffee shop on 26th and 8th street (which has a much larger seating area, better tasting and organic, and again has friendlier service)... This is if you are willing to spend the absurd amount of money this store is asking for sub-par service.The store itself is located next to a pet grooming shop (I`ll let that sink in... food preparation / pet grooming) and also a rather seedy bodega. Frankly, it would be cheaper to go into the bodega for a Lipton tea and breakfast sandwich. There is an incredible doughnut shop on 23rd between 7th and 8th... The other higher quality/friendlier options in the area are endless. When people say this establishment has the &#34;most amazing bagels&#34;, I am reminded (having lived in Chelsea my entire life) that is a constant stream of people who are new to the area and haven`t tried some of the other incredible offerings in the area... case in point Sullivan Street Bakery (a block away on 25th and 9th). I chanced it and went in after writing it off since the rude and incompetent new manager took it over; and am reminded why it`s better to spend your money elsewhere.

I asked for a black tea, specifically English breakfast... the new manager ignored this request and gave me a Lipton tea because... idk I guess my money ain&#39;t green enough. If you are going to charge 12 dollars for a sausage, egg, and cheese and small cup of tea please don`t screw up something so simple. No one said thank you. I had to impose/ask that my order be taken, not &#34;hi can I get you something&#34;. Thje manager who was on the floor, didn`t offer a greeting even though it was 7:45 am and not yet busy. Waiting to pay I got cut off by some other customer and despite there being 10-11 employees behind the counter no one preserved any semblance of order.I guess the store has decided that they have become too popular to maintain the same standards of service they once provided. There are a few employees who have been there since the beginning and are the saving grace of the entire experience. However based on the incompetence of the new manager, one would be better off going a block away to Murray`s bagels (whose products taste better and whose service is friendlier), or the other coffee shop on 26th and 8th street (which has a much larger seating area, better tasting and organic, and again has friendlier service)... This is if you are willing to spend the absurd amount of money this store is asking for sub-par service.The store itself is located next to a pet grooming shop (I`ll let that sink in... food preparation / pet grooming) and also a rather seedy bodega. Frankly, it would be cheaper to go into the bodega for a Lipton tea and breakfast sandwich. There is an incredible doughnut shop on 23rd between 7th and 8th... The other higher quality/friendlier options in the area are endless. When people say this establishment has the &#34;most amazing bagels&#34;, I am reminded (having lived in Chelsea my entire life) that is a constant stream of people who are new to the area and haven`t tried some of the other incredible offerings in the area... case in point Sullivan Street Bakery (a block away on 25th and 9th). I chanced it and went in after writing it off since the rude and incompetent new manager took it over; and am reminded why it`s better to spend your money elsewhere.

My partner and I were taking out two clients of ours and we wanted this to be special.

Then I spoke to the owner who did nothing, did not even offer an apology - just kept saying he had a great restaurant. HA!Here&#39;s just a bit of what happened. The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

I wasn&#39;t very hungry, so I ordered the &#34;flank steak,&#34; per my waiter&#39;s recommendation. I ordered my flank steak medium rare, but what I had delivered to my table were three charred pieces of steak that were almost well in the inside. The flank steak was so chewy that my teeth and gums hurt when I left.I ordered a drink named, &#34;The Last Word.&#34; I wanted to rename it &#34;My Last Drink,&#34; because it was the worst drink I&#39;ve EVER had and the fact that it cost $14.95 only added insult to injury.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to.

My partner and I were taking out two clients of ours and we wanted this to be special.

Then I spoke to the owner who did nothing, did not even offer an apology - just kept saying he had a great restaurant. HA!Here&#39;s just a bit of what happened. The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless. They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop. It was laughable - except for the check - $184.00 for 4 people (with a very small tip - it actually should have been $195.00) with only ordering one entree and one coffee each - and oh the Pellegrino.Stay away from this place!!!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 451}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "First time ordering delivery from here.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to.

Then I spoke to the owner who did nothing, did not even offer an apology - just kept saying he had a great restaurant. HA!Here&#39;s just a bit of what happened. The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless. They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop. It was laughable - except for the check - $184.00 for 4 people (with a very small tip - it actually should have been $195.00) with only ordering one entree and one coffee each - and oh the Pellegrino.Stay away from this place!!!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 777}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "First time ordering delivery from here.

She told me I was all set.I arrived exactly on time, and told the hostess my name and that I had a reservation. She said she didn&#39;t have a reservation for that name at all and that I would need to wait. I told her that someone was clearly lying as, one person said I was &#34;all set&#34; for my reservation and one other person saying there was no reservation. I asked her what she could do and she said nothing, i would have to wait. Then she started explaining to me that even when you have a reservation, sometimes people stay at their tables longer, thus you don&#39;t get seated on time. I said that is fine but you just told me I don&#39;t have a reservation. She seemed really confused and was also very rude the entire time and did not even apologize once. I used to work in the service industry and even if I wasn&#39;t the one to mess up, I would still apologize to the customer. I can&#39;t believe this hostess has a job, to be honest. I was looking forward to a good time, eating good food but I was denied that by some incompetent employee. I am an understanding person but the fact that she kept making excuses and then didn&#39;t even apologize really just make the situation even worse.", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 875}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "I literally just called this place to ask a question about their brunch and to possibly make a reservation and the woman hung up on me...unbelievable.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

I wasn&#39;t very hungry, so I ordered the &#34;flank steak,&#34; per my waiter&#39;s recommendation. I ordered my flank steak medium rare, but what I had delivered to my table were three charred pieces of steak that were almost well in the inside. The flank steak was so chewy that my teeth and gums hurt when I left.I ordered a drink named, &#34;The Last Word.&#34; I wanted to rename it &#34;My Last Drink,&#34; because it was the worst drink I&#39;ve EVER had and the fact that it cost $14.95 only added insult to injury.

Then I spoke to the owner who did nothing, did not even offer an apology - just kept saying he had a great restaurant. HA!Here&#39;s just a bit of what happened. The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless. They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop. It was laughable - except for the check - $184.00 for 4 people (with a very small tip - it actually should have been $195.00) with only ordering one entree and one coffee each - and oh the Pellegrino.Stay away from this place!!!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1044}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "First time ordering delivery from here.

I asked her what she could do and she said nothing, i would have to wait. Then she started explaining to me that even when you have a reservation, sometimes people stay at their tables longer, thus you don&#39;t get seated on time. I said that is fine but you just told me I don&#39;t have a reservation. She seemed really confused and was also very rude the entire time and did not even apologize once.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

When asked where is the rest of the steak he said over there, at my friends rib eye.If you have to have a steak go to another steak house in the city, old doesn&#39;t mean it is any good.", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1190}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "10", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1191}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "10", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1192}, {"Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1193}, {"Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "38", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "326", "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1194}, {"Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1195}, {"Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1196}, {"Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1197}, {"Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1198}, {"Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1199}, {"Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "0", "Review ": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1200}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "6", "Review ": "The simple fact that I am writing a negative review about this place makes me sad.

I asked her what she could do and she said nothing, i would have to wait. Then she started explaining to me that even when you have a reservation, sometimes people stay at their tables longer, thus you don&#39;t get seated on time. I said that is fine but you just told me I don&#39;t have a reservation. She seemed really confused and was also very rude the entire time and did not even apologize once.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless. They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

The soup was good but I thought $9 was really over priced. The crab cakes were excellent (my friends also loved them).I love seafoods. So, I ordered the linguini with clam sauce. Unfortunately, by considering the Manhattan price, I was not so impressed for this meal. My friend had a salmon dish and he was very happy about it.

The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

Only one word to describe my experience, &#34;UNDERWHELMED.&#34;When we arrived at the restaurant around 4:30, it was almost empty, as there was only one other set of patrons in the restaurant area and a few people at the bar. I wasn&#39;t very hungry, so I ordered the &#34;flank steak,&#34; per my waiter&#39;s recommendation. I ordered my flank steak medium rare, but what I had delivered to my table were three charred pieces of steak that were almost well in the inside. The flank steak was so chewy that my teeth and gums hurt when I left.I ordered a drink named, &#34;The Last Word.&#34; I wanted to rename it &#34;My Last Drink,&#34; because it was the worst drink I&#39;ve EVER had and the fact that it cost $14.95 only added insult to injury. I took two sips and could not bare another swallow.Apparently, our waiter was relieved when his shift ended; however, no one informed us. His replacement slinked past our table several times without saying one word, and later offered the explanation that the original waiter had been there since early that morning.

They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to.

Then I spoke to the owner who did nothing, did not even offer an apology - just kept saying he had a great restaurant. HA!Here&#39;s just a bit of what happened. The servers were all over us when we arrived, yet it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention when we were ready to order. I got the completely wrong dish!! I ordered the fish special and got some other fish from the menu. My partner&#39;s dish was tasteless, our client&#39;s Pasta Puttanesca had so much sauce on it, it looked like it came from the dreaded Olive Garden AND, she said it was tasteless. They tried to clear some people&#39;s plates before we were finished. They served bread on the wrong plate for one person, with no effort to correct. They kept opening and pouring bottles of Pellegrino when we told them repeatedly to stop. It was laughable - except for the check - $184.00 for 4 people (with a very small tip - it actually should have been $195.00) with only ordering one entree and one coffee each - and oh the Pellegrino.Stay away from this place!!!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 1799}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "First time ordering delivery from here.

I asked her what she could do and she said nothing, i would have to wait. Then she started explaining to me that even when you have a reservation, sometimes people stay at their tables longer, thus you don&#39;t get seated on time. I said that is fine but you just told me I don&#39;t have a reservation. She seemed really confused and was also very rude the entire time and did not even apologize once.

I have eaten lunch at this establishment many times during the week and had a fine experience. Also, based on the comments below you can imagine why I was excited to partake in their brunch.The menu online very clearly states that the last seating for the unlimited champagne brunch is at 2:45 ( I would imagine after our complains this was probably changed on the website) We arrived a few minutes before our 2:45 reservation and are seated right away. Our waiter didn&#39;t come over for 15 minutes and but once he does he explains that champagne is free with our entree, so we get some juice to accompany our champagne. The juice arrived 10 minutes before our champagne did. We begin to sip as we peruse the menu.3PM arrives and our waiter tells us that the brunch is over and we cannot have anymore champagne. We are quite confused and explain that 1. the website clearly states the last seating for the 2 hour brunch is at 2:45 2. when we sat down the waiter also mentions that champagne is free with our entrees. We explain that we will not be ordering our entrees if this is the case and we are more than happy to speak to a manager. He leaves, does not return for a very long time. Another person at our table goes to the hostess stand to try to get the attention of anyone on the waitstaff. The waiter finally returns with another bottle of champagne and we place our orders. Our meals arrive (promptly and tasted quite good) and then about 15 minutes later a manager, Jorge, finally comes over to tell us we will not be receiving any more champagne because it ended at 3PM. We again, express that it is clearly stated that we had a 2 hour brunch as long as we are seated at 2:45. We express that we made it clear to the waiter we wouldn&#39;t have even ordered food if we need the situation (there are plenty of other brunch places in the area i.e. Stone Street Tavern or 121 Fulton) He was incredibly rude and short, we explained that we wanted to speak to him before we ordered our food and he claimed he was unaware there was even a problem. We expressed our unhappiness and he seems very un-phased about how unpleasant this experience was and just kept repeating there would just be no more champagne. The customer service was just absolutely appalling. We asked to speak to his boss and he told us there was no one above him there, which seems odd to us in an establishment like Harry&#39;s for there to only be one manager above the waiter available to speak to. He was completely unapologetic and I don&#39;t think I have ever experienced a manager so disinterested in making the customer happy.

So, we looked at the menu and tried to make some sense of it.New menu lists the ORIGINAL 1.5 pound lobster with salad and fries as the ORIGINAL for $28.How the heck that equates to original is beyond me, because ORIGINALLY that meal was $20.The new, $20 meal menu entry boasts a 1 pound lobster.

so this young man the one that is telling the people to give in there tickets comes over she explains to him and he was still looking at me and saying well i don&#39;t know but we don&#39;t do that i told him but i will buy a tortilla just to eat the rest of this and he goes i do this time but not next time..grrrrrrrrr i took my tortilla all my wet soaked napkins in guamcam0le soaked sauced hands and ate the rest which i felt paper in my throat ...i won&#39;t return to lost tacos no. 1...i was not happy at all :(.....if they would have given me 2 extra thicker corn tortillas to replace the one paper thin flour one i would not have complained!!!

So, we looked at the menu and tried to make some sense of it.New menu lists the ORIGINAL 1.5 pound lobster with salad and fries as the ORIGINAL for $28.How the heck that equates to original is beyond me, because ORIGINALLY that meal was $20.The new, $20 meal menu entry boasts a 1 pound lobster.

We had just left Central Park when we called to see if they could accommodate a party of 7. They said if we were able to come in right now then they had a table ready. We were maybe 5 minutes away at this point so we agreed. Once there, we were informed that the previous party was paying and it should only be another 5 minutes. We confirmed the reservation name and phone number and because there was little room to stand, informed the hostess that we would be right outside and if she could let us know when our table is ready. After standing around for another 15 minutes outside, we decided to check in and found that our table had been given away, but that another table was becoming available soon. We decided not to leave and to make sure we got a table. While we were standing there, we noticed the waitress constantly coming up to a table by the door as though to hurry them up. We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving. We asked if any other table was available because it was very cold at this point and the constant opening of the door would be very uncomfortable. We were told to either take this table or have a 45 minute wait. What was supposed to be a no wait ordeal became a 25 minute wait at this point. We decided to take the table and approximately at 6:20 we were seated. The waitress came and took our orders.At this point, we were hoping it would go smoothly. But the food was a whole other story. While the drinks came in a timely fashion, all the entrees were given before the appetizers and the chicken in one of the pad Thai and Thai-herbed wings was dry and had a weird taste to it. Furthermore, as soon as we got our food, the waitress would come up to the table and take away dishes once they seemed relatively complete.

When I nominated the spot to my friends, they immediately agreed just to get out of the cold.From the moment we stepped inside, its as if all the cold was whisked away as we were greeted by our host, Michael. We didn&#39;t even have to wait a second to get seated, and there was a fair share of other people enjoying the warmth inside. As we sat and warmed ourselves, Michael made a recommendation that we start of with Chorba, the soup, seeing how we braved the freezing NYC weather....his recommendation was superb! My friends and I went with the chicken soup, which consisted of fresh chili peppers, and lentil....and it HIT THE SPOT! The chicken was tender, and fresh, and was cooked perfectly. Meanwhile, Michael is constantly making sure our cups are filled, and everything is alright.Afterwards for appetizers I went with the Shrimp, Chicken samosas. The shrimp was my FAVOURITE! They were grilled, marinated in sauce, and had a kick of great flavour! I just wish they weren&#39;t devoured so quickly. :(For the main course, we went with Chicken Vindaloo, Mixed Grill, and Lamb Chops! The chops were A-MAAAAZING! They were marinated with a great sauce, and the cook even added a little red wine to make the flavours come out...writing this review is making me hungry again btw...but anyways, the mixed grill my friend had was not over cooked, as some places tend to do...and had a large assortment of meats. (Maybe they should throw in some shrimp on that too)...the Chicken Vindaloo was paired perfectly with the naan and paratha (bread), the sauce was perfect for dipping.I purposely gave this place 4 stars, just to see if the service could be topped...and I dont doubt for a second that it wont.

I think its too over priced for that.(It always happen in NYC and I know it can&#39;t be helped, because they must paying very expensive rent!)But I really would like to mention about that we ordered bottle of water(unfortunately we don&#39;t drink alchol) which was FIJI water. it was $10(we always getting it from super market around $2-3)! but its ok, we need good water for good food..and FIji is one of the best water we can get in NYC. Anyways...please read below...They do not leave the water bottle on our table(I know it will be not looking good if Fiji water bottle was on the tables) so they everytime came to refill our glass with water from the Fiji water bottle they brings and it seems the bottle was sharing with another tables. When we had about 1.5 of glasses water, the lady came with silver pitcher and she refilled our glass with it. I had it, I tasted filtered tap water taste, and my husband as well. We called the waiter and told him about it, so they replaced our glass and filled with Fiji water. It was no problem with us. but....!In a while, the guy came to fill our glass with water from Fiji water bottle. After he filled our glass, I tasted filtered tap water again. But it was served from Fiji water bottle but taste very different, we were 100% sure it was filtered water. First 2 serves ware real Fiji water but the third one was filtered water. Whats happening in there?????? The bottle costs us $10 and they are refilling the Fiji water bottle with their filtered water????? Unbelievable experience at Daniels(in bad way).I may prefer to go to Euro or Montreal, may be California to go to eat great french food even though I need to pay for the flight ticket but I think it will so much worth than you waste your money in NYC.", "Friendcount": "1", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 42}, {"Ratings": 2.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "Went to Daniel in Sept.

When I called candle cafe, the manager said she would look into the matter. I received a call from candle cafe apologizing that indeed, they didn&#39;t have gf pasta and instead gave my daughter regular pasta.

We had just left Central Park when we called to see if they could accommodate a party of 7. They said if we were able to come in right now then they had a table ready. We were maybe 5 minutes away at this point so we agreed. Once there, we were informed that the previous party was paying and it should only be another 5 minutes. We confirmed the reservation name and phone number and because there was little room to stand, informed the hostess that we would be right outside and if she could let us know when our table is ready. After standing around for another 15 minutes outside, we decided to check in and found that our table had been given away, but that another table was becoming available soon. We decided not to leave and to make sure we got a table. While we were standing there, we noticed the waitress constantly coming up to a table by the door as though to hurry them up. We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving. We asked if any other table was available because it was very cold at this point and the constant opening of the door would be very uncomfortable. We were told to either take this table or have a 45 minute wait. What was supposed to be a no wait ordeal became a 25 minute wait at this point. We decided to take the table and approximately at 6:20 we were seated. The waitress came and took our orders.At this point, we were hoping it would go smoothly. But the food was a whole other story. While the drinks came in a timely fashion, all the entrees were given before the appetizers and the chicken in one of the pad Thai and Thai-herbed wings was dry and had a weird taste to it. Furthermore, as soon as we got our food, the waitress would come up to the table and take away dishes once they seemed relatively complete.

Our waitress didn&#39;t seem to rush his food to the table at all and my father and I finished eating about 20 minutes later (sharing some of our dishes with my brother), until we had no food left. When his food finally arrived at the table, my father immediately asked the server to pack it to go, as we where already done eating. He gave us a really pissed off look, and we all thought he was going to spit in the to-go container. We quickly paid the check and headed for the door, leaving the left overs at Up Thai.

When I nominated the spot to my friends, they immediately agreed just to get out of the cold.From the moment we stepped inside, its as if all the cold was whisked away as we were greeted by our host, Michael. We didn&#39;t even have to wait a second to get seated, and there was a fair share of other people enjoying the warmth inside. As we sat and warmed ourselves, Michael made a recommendation that we start of with Chorba, the soup, seeing how we braved the freezing NYC weather....his recommendation was superb! My friends and I went with the chicken soup, which consisted of fresh chili peppers, and lentil....and it HIT THE SPOT! The chicken was tender, and fresh, and was cooked perfectly. Meanwhile, Michael is constantly making sure our cups are filled, and everything is alright.Afterwards for appetizers I went with the Shrimp, Chicken samosas. The shrimp was my FAVOURITE! They were grilled, marinated in sauce, and had a kick of great flavour! I just wish they weren&#39;t devoured so quickly. :(For the main course, we went with Chicken Vindaloo, Mixed Grill, and Lamb Chops! The chops were A-MAAAAZING! They were marinated with a great sauce, and the cook even added a little red wine to make the flavours come out...writing this review is making me hungry again btw...but anyways, the mixed grill my friend had was not over cooked, as some places tend to do...and had a large assortment of meats. (Maybe they should throw in some shrimp on that too)...the Chicken Vindaloo was paired perfectly with the naan and paratha (bread), the sauce was perfect for dipping.I purposely gave this place 4 stars, just to see if the service could be topped...and I dont doubt for a second that it wont.

So we told him it was for my birthday. They served me a special birthday dessert plate. I was very happy and appreciated:)And the food, was okay but nothing was impressed. I think its too over priced for that.(It always happen in NYC and I know it can&#39;t be helped, because they must paying very expensive rent!)But I really would like to mention about that we ordered bottle of water(unfortunately we don&#39;t drink alchol) which was FIJI water. it was $10(we always getting it from super market around $2-3)! but its ok, we need good water for good food..and FIji is one of the best water we can get in NYC. Anyways...please read below...They do not leave the water bottle on our table(I know it will be not looking good if Fiji water bottle was on the tables) so they everytime came to refill our glass with water from the Fiji water bottle they brings and it seems the bottle was sharing with another tables. When we had about 1.5 of glasses water, the lady came with silver pitcher and she refilled our glass with it. I had it, I tasted filtered tap water taste, and my husband as well. We called the waiter and told him about it, so they replaced our glass and filled with Fiji water. It was no problem with us. but....!In a while, the guy came to fill our glass with water from Fiji water bottle. After he filled our glass, I tasted filtered tap water again. But it was served from Fiji water bottle but taste very different, we were 100% sure it was filtered water. First 2 serves ware real Fiji water but the third one was filtered water. Whats happening in there?????? The bottle costs us $10 and they are refilling the Fiji water bottle with their filtered water?????

I received a call from candle cafe apologizing that indeed, they didn&#39;t have gf pasta and instead gave my daughter regular pasta.

We had just left Central Park when we called to see if they could accommodate a party of 7. They said if we were able to come in right now then they had a table ready. We were maybe 5 minutes away at this point so we agreed. Once there, we were informed that the previous party was paying and it should only be another 5 minutes. We confirmed the reservation name and phone number and because there was little room to stand, informed the hostess that we would be right outside and if she could let us know when our table is ready. After standing around for another 15 minutes outside, we decided to check in and found that our table had been given away, but that another table was becoming available soon. We decided not to leave and to make sure we got a table. While we were standing there, we noticed the waitress constantly coming up to a table by the door as though to hurry them up. We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving. We asked if any other table was available because it was very cold at this point and the constant opening of the door would be very uncomfortable. We were told to either take this table or have a 45 minute wait. What was supposed to be a no wait ordeal became a 25 minute wait at this point. We decided to take the table and approximately at 6:20 we were seated. The waitress came and took our orders.At this point, we were hoping it would go smoothly. But the food was a whole other story. While the drinks came in a timely fashion, all the entrees were given before the appetizers and the chicken in one of the pad Thai and Thai-herbed wings was dry and had a weird taste to it. Furthermore, as soon as we got our food, the waitress would come up to the table and take away dishes once they seemed relatively complete.

Our waitress didn&#39;t seem to rush his food to the table at all and my father and I finished eating about 20 minutes later (sharing some of our dishes with my brother), until we had no food left. When his food finally arrived at the table, my father immediately asked the server to pack it to go, as we where already done eating. He gave us a really pissed off look, and we all thought he was going to spit in the to-go container. We quickly paid the check and headed for the door, leaving the left overs at Up Thai.

When I nominated the spot to my friends, they immediately agreed just to get out of the cold.From the moment we stepped inside, its as if all the cold was whisked away as we were greeted by our host, Michael. We didn&#39;t even have to wait a second to get seated, and there was a fair share of other people enjoying the warmth inside. As we sat and warmed ourselves, Michael made a recommendation that we start of with Chorba, the soup, seeing how we braved the freezing NYC weather....his recommendation was superb! My friends and I went with the chicken soup, which consisted of fresh chili peppers, and lentil....and it HIT THE SPOT! The chicken was tender, and fresh, and was cooked perfectly. Meanwhile, Michael is constantly making sure our cups are filled, and everything is alright.Afterwards for appetizers I went with the Shrimp, Chicken samosas. The shrimp was my FAVOURITE! They were grilled, marinated in sauce, and had a kick of great flavour! I just wish they weren&#39;t devoured so quickly. :(For the main course, we went with Chicken Vindaloo, Mixed Grill, and Lamb Chops! The chops were A-MAAAAZING! They were marinated with a great sauce, and the cook even added a little red wine to make the flavours come out...writing this review is making me hungry again btw...but anyways, the mixed grill my friend had was not over cooked, as some places tend to do...and had a large assortment of meats. (Maybe they should throw in some shrimp on that too)...the Chicken Vindaloo was paired perfectly with the naan and paratha (bread), the sauce was perfect for dipping.I purposely gave this place 4 stars, just to see if the service could be topped...and I dont doubt for a second that it wont.

I will say the optional foie gras dish was amazing, but I should not have to add a dish to a chefs tasting menu to find a memorable dish. Even as good as it was, the foie gras and eel appetizer at Morimotos is better. The service and wine pairings were impeccable, make no mistake. The food is just so much better at too many other NYC restaurants to pay that kind of price for food that was nothing memorable.", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 324}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "over price bad service", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 325}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "3", "Review ": "Not even a bibe gormande worthy!

I think its too over priced for that.(It always happen in NYC and I know it can&#39;t be helped, because they must paying very expensive rent!)But I really would like to mention about that we ordered bottle of water(unfortunately we don&#39;t drink alchol) which was FIJI water. it was $10(we always getting it from super market around $2-3)! but its ok, we need good water for good food..and FIji is one of the best water we can get in NYC. Anyways...please read below...They do not leave the water bottle on our table(I know it will be not looking good if Fiji water bottle was on the tables) so they everytime came to refill our glass with water from the Fiji water bottle they brings and it seems the bottle was sharing with another tables. When we had about 1.5 of glasses water, the lady came with silver pitcher and she refilled our glass with it. I had it, I tasted filtered tap water taste, and my husband as well. We called the waiter and told him about it, so they replaced our glass and filled with Fiji water. It was no problem with us. but....!In a while, the guy came to fill our glass with water from Fiji water bottle. After he filled our glass, I tasted filtered tap water again. But it was served from Fiji water bottle but taste very different, we were 100% sure it was filtered water. First 2 serves ware real Fiji water but the third one was filtered water. Whats happening in there?????? The bottle costs us $10 and they are refilling the Fiji water bottle with their filtered water?????

Not only isn&#39;t the food particularly good, the portions are small(not that you would want more of something bad), and this is not a CHEAP place. The service is good. I never really experienced any problems with the staff. They were all helpful and competent. And I tipped them well.The Candle Cafe is kind of a fancy NYC type place for &#34;ladies who lunch&#34;. So maybe if you want a little NYC atmosphere and a place that&#39;s usually packed(not because of the food) and your meeting a friend for lunch, order the salad. I would imagine that It&#39;s pretty difficult to make a bad salad, even for the Candle Cafe!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 412}, {"Ratings": 2.0, "Reviewcount": "2", "Review ": "First impression: I ordered the southern platter for lunch...meh.

We had just left Central Park when we called to see if they could accommodate a party of 7. They said if we were able to come in right now then they had a table ready. We were maybe 5 minutes away at this point so we agreed. Once there, we were informed that the previous party was paying and it should only be another 5 minutes. We confirmed the reservation name and phone number and because there was little room to stand, informed the hostess that we would be right outside and if she could let us know when our table is ready.

We decided not to leave and to make sure we got a table. While we were standing there, we noticed the waitress constantly coming up to a table by the door as though to hurry them up. We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving. We asked if any other table was available because it was very cold at this point and the constant opening of the door would be very uncomfortable. We were told to either take this table or have a 45 minute wait. What was supposed to be a no wait ordeal became a 25 minute wait at this point. We decided to take the table and approximately at 6:20 we were seated. The waitress came and took our orders.At this point, we were hoping it would go smoothly. But the food was a whole other story. While the drinks came in a timely fashion, all the entrees were given before the appetizers and the chicken in one of the pad Thai and Thai-herbed wings was dry and had a weird taste to it.

When I nominated the spot to my friends, they immediately agreed just to get out of the cold.From the moment we stepped inside, its as if all the cold was whisked away as we were greeted by our host, Michael. We didn&#39;t even have to wait a second to get seated, and there was a fair share of other people enjoying the warmth inside. As we sat and warmed ourselves, Michael made a recommendation that we start of with Chorba, the soup, seeing how we braved the freezing NYC weather....his recommendation was superb! My friends and I went with the chicken soup, which consisted of fresh chili peppers, and lentil....and it HIT THE SPOT! The chicken was tender, and fresh, and was cooked perfectly. Meanwhile, Michael is constantly making sure our cups are filled, and everything is alright.Afterwards for appetizers I went with the Shrimp, Chicken samosas. The shrimp was my FAVOURITE! They were grilled, marinated in sauce, and had a kick of great flavour! I just wish they weren&#39;t devoured so quickly. :(For the main course, we went with Chicken Vindaloo, Mixed Grill, and Lamb Chops! The chops were A-MAAAAZING! They were marinated with a great sauce, and the cook even added a little red wine to make the flavours come out...writing this review is making me hungry again btw...but anyways, the mixed grill my friend had was not over cooked, as some places tend to do...and had a large assortment of meats. (Maybe they should throw in some shrimp on that too)...the Chicken Vindaloo was paired perfectly with the naan and paratha (bread), the sauce was perfect for dipping.I purposely gave this place 4 stars, just to see if the service could be topped...and I dont doubt for a second that it wont.

We had just left Central Park when we called to see if they could accommodate a party of 7. They said if we were able to come in right now then they had a table ready. We were maybe 5 minutes away at this point so we agreed. Once there, we were informed that the previous party was paying and it should only be another 5 minutes. We confirmed the reservation name and phone number and because there was little room to stand, informed the hostess that we would be right outside and if she could let us know when our table is ready.

We decided not to leave and to make sure we got a table. While we were standing there, we noticed the waitress constantly coming up to a table by the door as though to hurry them up. We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving. We asked if any other table was available because it was very cold at this point and the constant opening of the door would be very uncomfortable. We were told to either take this table or have a 45 minute wait. What was supposed to be a no wait ordeal became a 25 minute wait at this point.

While the drinks came in a timely fashion, all the entrees were given before the appetizers and the chicken in one of the pad Thai and Thai-herbed wings was dry and had a weird taste to it.

But it was served from Fiji water bottle but taste very different, we were 100% sure it was filtered water. First 2 serves ware real Fiji water but the third one was filtered water. Whats happening in there?????? The bottle costs us $10 and they are refilling the Fiji water bottle with their filtered water?????

I heard nothing, but positive raves from friends and never read any bad comments, which was why this experience was so upsetting. I really wanted to enjoy eating here. I really wanted it to become a tradition. Plus my boyfriend is still new to the vegan thing.I had no idea there was a set menu, which was my mistake. I should have double checked, but I&#39;m from California and I never had been to a place that has set menus in my life. Let me also add that I&#39;m still in my second year of my undergraduate studies.So Again set menu. over 150 dollars for the both of us. I knew dinner was going to be expensive, but 150 dollars is a fourth of my rent and I work two days a week and go to school full time. 150 dollars is literally a week&#39;s worth of work.My boyfriend looked at the menu saw the price and the options and instantly wanted to leave. I saw that he was uncomfortable so I wanted to as well. I also didn&#39;t want to spend 163 dollars on food that neither of us were going to enjoy. Even the ambiance was tainted at this point.The manager saw we were leaving and stopped us in the middle of the walk way and said we could just share if we were going to leave. Still and $80 dollar check. She did this infront of a bunch of people and I don&#39;t care what people think, but it was beyond unprofessional.We ended up sitting back at our table to get up again and walk down stairs to leave where the manager stood in front of the exit keeping me from walking out. she threatened to still charge me $50 for walking out because it goes as a no show. Let me also point out a woman was waiting to be seated. Every chair was taken at the bar and the rest of the place and everyone wanted to be eating there. They had turned four couples away while we were just waiting to be sat.So my boyfriend was getting upset over me getting charged for nothing and at this point I was over it. The charge, Candle 79 everything. To put the cherry on top another staff worker I&#39;m not sure if she was a manager or what, but she started eavesdropping on our conversation. I understand if you want to serve guests, but treat them as guests. Do not act unprofessional no matter what the circumstance.With that we walked out and I told the manager to go ahead and charge me. Almost a month later and I have yet to be charged. We ended up at a mexican cantina called, Gina Mexicana. Where we were both able to eat the best mexican food on the east coast, have a margarita, and a shot as well as a better experience all for under $50.Candle 79 can have the first half of my Valentine&#39;s day, but that&#39;s all they get.

Candle cafe markets itself as being allergy friendly and even has its own gluten free menu. I am always very careful and explicit about our food restrictions. Today, my daughter with celiac disease was given wheat pasta at candle cafe after the server and cooks were told several times she needed a gf meal with no cross contamination. I asked 4 times if the pasta was gf and was reassured repeatedly that her meal was safe.Well, shortly after leaving candle cafe, my daughter became very ill and spent the afternoon doubled over in pain and vomiting. When I called candle cafe, the manager said she would look into the matter. I received a call from candle cafe apologizing that indeed, they didn&#39;t have gf pasta and instead gave my daughter regular pasta. As someone who needs to be vigilant, I am understanding when cross contamination occurs in a kitchen. It can be very hard to control for that, but to outright give a person with celiac disease regular wheat pasta is beyond negligent. I will NEVER eat there again.

The atmosphere is well known to any regular. A rather cramped bar / dining area, thronged with customers and shuttling waitstaff. Still, this is one of Manhattan&#39;s best burgers, so, you go for that. One characteristic of this place is that the host/hostess and the bar staff can often be pretty difficult and arrogant. The stuffy, mostly well-to-do clientele, often adorned in arbitrarily nautically themed clothing, find this charming, I suppose. I did get a few stiff vodka sodas for a reasonable price while we waited, which made it all the more palatable. The melodrama started when our table was ready for 4... but we had 5 in the party... an honest mistake. We were sternly scolded and moved to the bottom of the queue. An extra chair could have been added to the table, but was not - not doubt this is managerial policy, so, you can&#39;t really hold it against the hostess - but there are ways to go about things, and ways to go about things. Staff here often seem to go out of their way to be rude and belittle you - essentially to remind you what a privilege it is to eat there and how they can&#39;t be bothered to go about treating you in a nice way - demand is high. I was pretty mellow from the vodka, so we decided to wait the next table to come free. In the mean time I dumped $2 in quarters in the juke box.. but, turns out the coin slot doesn&#39;t work. No sign posted! Coin slot not blocked! I mention this to a staff member who was concerned enough to forward my dilemma to the bar staff, but the bar staff immediately chose to ignore me. Brushing me off because (couldn&#39;t I see) they were &#34;busy.&#34; I mean, it is only $2.. but, WTF, this is a business establishment... if your customer loses any money using your services, it behooves you to refund the money. Suffice to say, they would not return my jukebox money - I decided not to make a big thing about it. But WTF, complete jerks. Finally we got our table. Most of the burgers were fine, BUT, at least one of them had charcoal black, burnt bacon -- I mean absurdly overdone. You&#39;d think after such an obnoxious initial experience, at least the food would be perfect. The table service was fine, we decided not to make a scene about the bacon, after all we just wanted to eat and get the hell out. The prices are high for what you get, but you know that going in. Overall I would say that, as a customer of this place for many years - finally I have lost my patience with the attitude of the staff. I don&#39;t need people to be extra nice and wish me to have a nice day - but it&#39;s always a plus when people do treat you with common decency and when they don&#39;t act like if you lose money due to their faulty jukebox, it is instead your problem.

We were informed that they already paid and are going to be leaving.

When we had about 1.5 of glasses water, the lady came with silver pitcher and she refilled our glass with it. I had it, I tasted filtered tap water taste, and my husband as well. We called the waiter and told him about it, so they replaced our glass and filled with Fiji water.

I heard nothing, but positive raves from friends and never read any bad comments, which was why this experience was so upsetting. I really wanted to enjoy eating here. I really wanted it to become a tradition. Plus my boyfriend is still new to the vegan thing.I had no idea there was a set menu, which was my mistake. I should have double checked, but I&#39;m from California and I never had been to a place that has set menus in my life. Let me also add that I&#39;m still in my second year of my undergraduate studies.So Again set menu. over 150 dollars for the both of us. I knew dinner was going to be expensive, but 150 dollars is a fourth of my rent and I work two days a week and go to school full time. 150 dollars is literally a week&#39;s worth of work.My boyfriend looked at the menu saw the price and the options and instantly wanted to leave. I saw that he was uncomfortable so I wanted to as well. I also didn&#39;t want to spend 163 dollars on food that neither of us were going to enjoy. Even the ambiance was tainted at this point.The manager saw we were leaving and stopped us in the middle of the walk way and said we could just share if we were going to leave. Still and $80 dollar check. She did this infront of a bunch of people and I don&#39;t care what people think, but it was beyond unprofessional.We ended up sitting back at our table to get up again and walk down stairs to leave where the manager stood in front of the exit keeping me from walking out. she threatened to still charge me $50 for walking out because it goes as a no show. Let me also point out a woman was waiting to be seated. Every chair was taken at the bar and the rest of the place and everyone wanted to be eating there. They had turned four couples away while we were just waiting to be sat.So my boyfriend was getting upset over me getting charged for nothing and at this point I was over it. The charge, Candle 79 everything. To put the cherry on top another staff worker I&#39;m not sure if she was a manager or what, but she started eavesdropping on our conversation. I understand if you want to serve guests, but treat them as guests. Do not act unprofessional no matter what the circumstance.With that we walked out and I told the manager to go ahead and charge me. Almost a month later and I have yet to be charged. We ended up at a mexican cantina called, Gina Mexicana.

They were once famous for their vegan desserts like mock ice cream. Now its simply mock dessert. Made worse by the prices. $17.00 for dessert! Wow ...it better walk in water for that price. All in all a most disappointing experience. I took a veggie friend here and wound up with $100 check for a (at best) fair meal. Service only fair also (it too was once great).

I asked 4 times if the pasta was gf and was reassured repeatedly that her meal was safe.Well, shortly after leaving candle cafe, my daughter became very ill and spent the afternoon doubled over in pain and vomiting. When I called candle cafe, the manager said she would look into the matter. I received a call from candle cafe apologizing that indeed, they didn&#39;t have gf pasta and instead gave my daughter regular pasta. As someone who needs to be vigilant, I am understanding when cross contamination occurs in a kitchen.

The atmosphere is well known to any regular. A rather cramped bar / dining area, thronged with customers and shuttling waitstaff. Still, this is one of Manhattan&#39;s best burgers, so, you go for that. One characteristic of this place is that the host/hostess and the bar staff can often be pretty difficult and arrogant. The stuffy, mostly well-to-do clientele, often adorned in arbitrarily nautically themed clothing, find this charming, I suppose. I did get a few stiff vodka sodas for a reasonable price while we waited, which made it all the more palatable. The melodrama started when our table was ready for 4... but we had 5 in the party... an honest mistake. We were sternly scolded and moved to the bottom of the queue. An extra chair could have been added to the table, but was not - not doubt this is managerial policy, so, you can&#39;t really hold it against the hostess - but there are ways to go about things, and ways to go about things. Staff here often seem to go out of their way to be rude and belittle you - essentially to remind you what a privilege it is to eat there and how they can&#39;t be bothered to go about treating you in a nice way - demand is high. I was pretty mellow from the vodka, so we decided to wait the next table to come free. In the mean time I dumped $2 in quarters in the juke box.. but, turns out the coin slot doesn&#39;t work. No sign posted! Coin slot not blocked! I mention this to a staff member who was concerned enough to forward my dilemma to the bar staff, but the bar staff immediately chose to ignore me. Brushing me off because (couldn&#39;t I see) they were &#34;busy.&#34; I mean, it is only $2.. but, WTF, this is a business establishment... if your customer loses any money using your services, it behooves you to refund the money. Suffice to say, they would not return my jukebox money - I decided not to make a big thing about it. But WTF, complete jerks. Finally we got our table. Most of the burgers were fine, BUT, at least one of them had charcoal black, burnt bacon -- I mean absurdly overdone. You&#39;d think after such an obnoxious initial experience, at least the food would be perfect. The table service was fine, we decided not to make a scene about the bacon, after all we just wanted to eat and get the hell out. The prices are high for what you get, but you know that going in. Overall I would say that, as a customer of this place for many years - finally I have lost my patience with the attitude of the staff. I don&#39;t need people to be extra nice and wish me to have a nice day - but it&#39;s always a plus when people do treat you with common decency and when they don&#39;t act like if you lose money due to their faulty jukebox, it is instead your problem.

We saw 3 tables who got their food before we did, even though we were there first.I decided to ask TONNY(waitress) what was going on as we sat right by the kitchen were the waiters pass by constantly. They said that the food was almost ready so we decided to wait. I was really patient with them and waited another 20minutes with no food! (Mind you this is a small restaurant) So I asked them to put it to go because I was running late for a paid event. It took them another 15minutes to give us the packed food and that was just about the only thing they did right.They gave us a check and we asked for a discount since we saw 3 other tables get served, paid, and leave. I also told them to take off the milkshake that we ordered because it never came. They told us don&#39;t worry we are already working on a discount and took our credit cards. 5 minutes later the bartender came out with a small plastic cup and gave us the milkshake saying I have a surprise for you! You would think they were giving that on the house but nope. They wanted to keep the $7 milkshake on our receipts. None of the staff took blame and they were cheap as hell trying to charge us for everything.In the end, after an hour and 45mins of nothing they came back and charged us full price for the food. I walked up to all the workers just standing there asking what is going on because I was in a huge rush and they promised a discount and all they did was point out the owner to me who was just standing there. They told me I would be getting a 30% discount and they didn&#39;t need the credit cards anymore.Today, We checked our statements and they have not given us the discount. I&#39;m not sure if this has to do anything about it, but we were the only nonblacks in there and my friends were wearing LGBT stuff. We were really patient with them especially cause our friends were from out of town and their first day in New York. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE.  We ate the food in the car and the food wasn&#39;t even good anymore.", "Friendcount": "149", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 2}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "Review ": "Just awful!!!! After visiting 4 times in less than 10 days , this place has gone from bad to worse!! I have given it four chances as I thought it was new and they were just finding their feet, plus it was convenient as only a short distance from my house.I will keep it short .... As a female dining alone I was left waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement from two of the staff who walked straight past me twice, (there was only two table in at this time) after being told the key dishes were not available from the menu , I made a less enthusiastic choice from the remainder of the menu after the &#39;server&#39; could not recommend any dishes , the food came reasonably quickly , upon which I asked for some Mayo or sour cream , after my server walked around the resutuarnt filling waters and serving another table , upon a prompt from me I eventually got my dressing in a rather messy cup , I then asked what the desserts were which I was told. &#34;Cup cake or cookies&#34; to which I replied no cheesecake this evening ? (As I had previously had) she said&#34; yes baked or raw?&#34; So I requested baked. After 30 mins of waiting for said cheesecake, and yet another prompt I was delivered my much awaiting dessert, which looked/tasted completely different from my last visit , so after trying to get a servers attention away from their phones and sitting at the bar I asked another server what cheesecake this was to which he replied &#34;raw&#34; I stipulated this was not my request and he said they have no other although she had charged me for a baked cheesecake , this was taken away and off my bill, when I expressed my disappointment and continuous concerns front the min I arrived the serve just shrugged and walked off! So in short after various things too many to go into (blocked toilets , kitchen paper for toilet roll, and terrible terrible service) if you are looking for good food, good service and friendly environment then this is not the place for you, the main gentleman server has zero clue about service , I then find out that this business has been going for a while now so all the grace I gave it thinking they were new has now left a very bitter taste, the only reason this place is reasonably busy is because there is no other competition close by , but be prepared for long waits, awful service and over priced under whelming dishes (if they have any available ) there are a lot of easy fixes but lack of care or accountability !!!!

So we went.The List goes as followsFirst, we got our food before our water. Nuff said. Extremenly long wait for food...exceptionally Long. Like 45-minutes long.......WTF? Bad...just bad.Misleading Menu:Inaccurate descriptions of food. For Example, the juice had the consistency of a smoothie. The crawfish and seasoned vegetables were cooked in the same stew, adding no variation to the aesthetic appeal of the food, and reminded me of slop. Also, the menu didn&#39;t describe that there was cheese on the grits...that vegan velveeta-type cheese that was &#34;homemade&#34;...WHO TRAINED THESE PEOPLE. Your servers don&#39;t know what the food is made of or how it is made. If you don&#39;t know what it is made of, then simply say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. I felt like the menu items were extremely healthy and I didn&#39;t want to eat it at all...or extremely unhealthy and no one should probably eat it...Food Quality:Reminds me of Vegan Heart-attack slop, with no style.The Staff:Slow with their clean-up. There were tables in the restaurant that had dirty dishes on them for 20 minutes into us sitting down. We got our water after we got our food, which came 45 minutes into the meal. The waitress walked around with the debit card hanging out of the bill-fold for a few minutes, serving other customers instead of ringing the debit card on the machine, or even just securing it in a safe location by the register.Customers:The customers don&#39;t smile. Everyone looked upset, as if they were waiting way too long for their food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s true too. I saw two different accounts of customers returning their plates back to the kitchen, and one group of customers getting up to speak to management about the long wait and if there was anything they can make up real quick. Apparently, according to the manager &#34;everything is premade&#34;...really? So why does it take so long for the food to get to the customers table?How about the manager giving Lip to the customers? Speaking in a condescending tone, having an attitude about his own bad day. When me and my sis got home to look up the restaurant and reviews, we realized that this Dick-like Manager, was actually one of the Co-Owners. The son in the partnership. How could you...All in all, this place sucked and was a huge disappointment. I wish there were more vegan restaurants in Harlem. Seasoned Vegan is overly-salty, and sloppy. From their management, to their server, their food, and their clean-up process. I would never recommend this place, and will never be returning. I look forward to more vegan restaurants opening in Harlem. Please. Please.

Yes, I was curious and yes I went there extremely hungry in hopes that this would be an amazing meal! It was a Saturday evening...still early for a dinner rush so I thought this would be a quick and easy process to dine solo. I explained to my young waitress it was my first time there. She didn&#39;t seem too eager to explain anything or care to suggest any items. She just came back again and asked if I want to order? I finally chose the SV burger and asked if I can sub out the tomatoes for something else. I was told no. Even the vegan cheese was another $1-2 and extra for avocado. If I didn&#39;t get a topping, I basically got a bun with a soy patty. A bit stingy if you ask me. Even chips or fries on the side are not free. $16-17 bucks for a soy patty is a bit steep. Anyway, the order seem to take forever to complete. Like many other reviews listed below, the service was very off-putting. No one ever checked on me, refilled my water, or came back to ask if I wanted to order more. I literally had to wave my hands just to get water. They are not attentive at all! I finished my meal and sat with my hands folded for over 15 minutes and again no one ever stopped to ask if I wanted to order more or if they could bring the check. I did want to try dessert, but did not have the patience to wait for another long period just to order and then to pay. The service is what really ruins this place. Extremely frustrating! The burger was average. I might give it a second chance just to try some other menu items, but go early in the day. Perhaps when there are no other customers there, I might get some attention!!!

I wanted to take a friend here for a birthday and called around midnight to see if what time they were closing because I was informed different hours from a friend and the lady at the counter hung up. When I called back to ask the lady if she hung up or not she stated &#34;yeah I hung up&#34; because she supposedly couldn&#39;t hear me because, but after saying you heard me when i asked what time you guys close, she continued to say &#34; like I said I didn&#39;t hear you, I went on to say &#34; I&#39;m going to ask you again what time you guys close, and she finally stated the time.Its always our black establishments, that everyone seems to upset that they&#39;re taking orders etc, and they have to be at work. The customer service is horrible, and makes you not yant to eat there, but its one of the only places open late night besides IHOP in Harlem, and my first time at Amy Ruth&#39;s which people because we wanted to give it a try.When I arrived we were seated and our order was taken, the food came out in about 7 minutes.. I ordered catfish, Mac and cheese and collard greens. My friend ordered BBQ ribs/ chicken combo with Mac and cheese and corn. My catfish was salty and soggy, the greens were bland, and the Mac and cheese was cooked and topped with artificial cheese or a generic brand. I also ordered a peach mimosa which tasted like peaches mixed with orange soda, no alcohol in it. My friends ribs were chewy, over cooked, and the chicken was dry. I&#39;ve been to red rooster, Mannas, Silvia&#39;s all throughout Harlem and AMY RUTHS is by far the worse. Far from southern soul food, I am shocked people say this is the good food, but there aren&#39;t any good places to eat soul food anymore so people take what they can get Jacobs is better.Our waitress didn&#39;t ask us if we needed anything throughout the meal, if the food was good, if our glasses needed to be refilled... So after eating, I waited for someone to come over for about 15 minutes and no one came.. So I put my pointer finger up signaling for a waitress because all 6 or 7 of them were huddled on their cellphones at the counter. I made eye contact with one of the waitresses who then turned her head as if he didn&#39;t see us. When the waitress did come I said, I want the bill so I can go. She placed the bill on the table next to us instead of giving it to us directly, I paid and left. It took everything in me to stay calm, and try to enjoy the moment, but me and my friend simultaneously stated we we won&#39;t be back, our own food taste better", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 46}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "17", "Review ": "This was our first time visiting this place and since it has/had good reviews, we thought it okay for a group of visitors to the City to eat here.

We called this place twice before going to confirm they do not take reservations for parties of ten or more. They do not. We arrived at 11am, waited outside in the heat until we were seated around 1:30ish; we were seated in a dark back room that had no working air conditioner forget central air. The waitress was not friendly and seemed bothered that she had to wait on us. She gave menus out and fled for additional 1/2 hour without even taking our drink order. Remember we were in the heat for over two hours then seated in a dark hot room!She came back we gave our drink orders and she left and after a long while with hot drinks. Now the drinks were hot because in most of them there was no ICE. She took our orders and gone! Food finally arrived and no kidding only two plates of food were completely eaten. The rest was left due to being burnt, undone, and cold. The waffles and fried chicken two people ordered that the waffles were undone. The greens were bland and the cornbread NO ONE ate. Smh grave disappointment.We stopped a server who was serving another agitated group at a different table near us to get some ICE. We had to speak in a firm voice to this young adult that we needed ice for the drinks. He came back with THREE CUPS of Ice. Three cups for a group of over ten.

It seems like when there&#39;s toilet tissue, there&#39;s no soap and when there&#39;s soap, there&#39;s no toilet tissue. The wall tiles look disgustingly grimy, the outside of the toilet bowl has all kinds of stains and drips and the sink is nasty and had stuff accumulated around the drain. The last straw was over the weekend when I visited AR&#39;s with some friends. Thankfully my friend took her phone to the bathroom with her because she had to call me to bring her some tissue. It&#39;s a horrible thing to use the restroom only to realize that there&#39;s no tissue. I think that is unacceptable and why I am giving such a low rating.That being said the meal was delicious and enormous kudos to those responsible for actually making the food and the wait staff (who are always pleasant and accommodating, with the exception of one little guy with glasses). Over the years the consistency of how good the food is has remained the same.

I was very interested in going because it&#39;s only a short walk from my apartment. The food and our waiter were amazing. However, in the span of 10 minutes the manager Joel turned our experience very sour to say the least. When I went to the restroom with my brother the bathroom was clogged... typical situation at any NYC restaurant. My brother came out and apologized to the waiter because of the mess that he caused by flushing the already clogged toilet and tipped him because he knew someone had to clean it. He also offered to clean it himself since he also works in the restaurant industry and understands how annoying these situations can be. The waiter assured him that it would be taken care of and that it was fine. We went back to our table and asked for the bill. 2 minutes later Joel the manager approaches us and asks us &#34;are ya good?&#34; We answer yes we&#39;re waiting to pay. Again a few minutes after he comes again and says he has to removed our glasses which we say okay that&#39;s fine we were already done... thank you. I&#39;m paying for our bill and he then comes again gets in my brothers face and aggressively says &#34; I saw what the f**k you did in the bathroom!&#34; My brother tried to explain and again apologized but the manager continues to get in his face as if he wants to get physical. They yanked the bill from me and about 2 or 3 other workers come outside and start yelling at us. We&#39;re already out of the restaurant waiting to get a taxi to leave. They continue to scream that &#34;they&#39;ll remember us&#34; continue to curse at us and to make things worse have called the police. They handcuff my brother and throw him to the ground. I explained to them what happened and told an officer that we had paid the bill and that they should go check that my signature wasn&#39;t even completed because they took the bill from me before I was able to finish signing it.

I personally think because I am A GAY black male and mark is this &#34;Macho&#34; Caribbean black male, that he was surfing on BOARDERLINE HOMOPHOBIA.Mark likes to believe that he is this big guy that can intimidate people because of his muscular shape. Do not play into that. He wants to say he is doing this for the community... how it&#39;s all about &#34;his people&#34; but, how are you doing that if your charging $3 for a bottle of water? The guy in the hot dog truck infront of the shop charges $1 for the same thing? When lid or cups or anything as far a product would hit the floor mark would get really upset, if we threw them away. He would say &#34;That is wasteful, you could have still put them out&#34; or his favorite line &#34;If they don&#39;t know about them falling, how will it hurt them?&#34; with this stupid chuckle. Like whatttt!!!!! that&#39;s gross! Mark would get upset if you spoke up after he would talk down to us. When ever we would follow his rules, he would then turn it around on us like it is our fault. He suddenly would get amnesia and would say &#34;did I say that? I don&#39;t remember saying that.&#34; even though I would have text messages and emails of what was said. Everyone from the first team quit because mark did not enjoy the fact that we spoke up. The only person that is left is someone that basically would kiss up to mark (who spends most of his time on some gay hookup app name jack&#39;d). Whenever we spoke up mark would remove us off the working schedule. How can you play with someone&#39;s money like that? Three of the workers had children that they was taking care of as single parents. Mark did not care. if you had an opinion on something he would feel some kind of way about it. But what happen to freedom of speech? Is that thrown out the window once you enter his coffee shop?Mark doesn&#39;t care about his workers, Just about how he can use get the next sale.He wanted everyone to have there food safety license so he could go away on vacation, and his store would be safe. From when the store had opened, he went on vacation 3 times. that means he went on vacation once a month.. what kind of owner does that? When we got hired there was nothing stating that we needed to have our food safety licenses. Mark had gotten his AFTER the grand opening (How can you open a food establishment and not have your OWN Licenses and you are the OWNER!?) Marks words: &#34;I couldn&#39;t tell you guys to get yours when I don&#39;t have mind. Now that I have mine you all have 60 days to get it or you will be terminated.&#34; mmmhh such an amazing leader.Mark does nothing but spend his time swiping left or right on tinder. Hitting on the females that come in form time to time, Question people why don&#39;t they want to buy something, Eating his own product or sleeping in the back of the shop. When someone or something is important at the shop then he wants to be all hands on deck. The pay checks was also late. You want the employees to be on time for work but was late with the fund! where they do that at?!?I once ate a day old scone and had a small cup of tea. Mark is so money hungry that he made me pay for it. I threw it away and mark was upset.. a DAY OLD SCONE!I would think twice about the food there as the Bagels, Scones &amp; donuts are usually a day or two stale. Yes things do come in daily but they aren&#39;t put out unless they are not in stock to display. So when you are eating any of those thing listed, please take an extra look at your food before enjoying it. you wouldn&#39;t want the sandwich to have hold on it or anything. You would honestly have more of a better time at the stand that&#39;s is in front of the place.Again mark is not a nice person Literally the first group of staff all quit because mark was a shady person. Playing favorites with other staff, Talking down to us, Cursing and screaming at the staff meetings. Please don&#39;t let his Monkey type smile fool you.Hitler Installed fear in others, that what mark tried to do with his workers and from what I am reading, with some of the customers that come in to the shop.I will be responding with FACTS to all those bad reports on this place, because if u had a bad time just ordering and being within the space, imagine what it is like working there!", "Friendcount": "172", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 91}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "3", "Review ": "My almond croissant came to just under $6.

My friend and his colleague will now be able to boast they&#39;ve been to RDV long before any of their friends ever knew about it.The dishes were on point, every time. The portions are small, and our waiter probably should have recommended ordering breads and spreads to supplement the dishes, but otherwise the service was immaculate. Respectful and friendly, never condescending (like some of these French Bistros tend to be).Our 8 year old daughter couldn&#39;t get enough of the grilled octopus. She also picked the venison and the entrecote, and it was amazing to see her enjoy dishes she&#39;s not used to: she&#39;s not the pickiest eater but recently she&#39;s been reluctant to try new things. A dad can&#39;t be more proud than when seeing his daughter joyfully eat every single dish and ask for more!The chef (Kfir Ben-Ari) kept stopping by all the tables, speaking with his guests - some he knew, others were obviously there for the first time but he just made everyone feel so at home! This is no stuck up French Bistro. His human touch and his uncanny knack for social interaction (apparently he speaks 4 languages fluently..) made us feel like it&#39;s a communal space.That being said it&#39;s still a great place for a romantic dinner, and there were 2 couples in a corner that seemed really comfortable and happy in their own intimate space.I was mostly impressed with the attention to detail. Every dish looked like a work of art, and tasted even better. I loved the grilled octopus too, just like my daughter did, and the entrecote was perfectly made.I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try some of the rest of the dishes on my next visit: this is the type of place where you can easily try your luck: you will not be disappointed no matter what you pick, and you get to try things you&#39;ve never had before, prepared in the finest possible way and in the most creative possible way.We will be back with more friends, very soon!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 133}, {"Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "Chef Kfir cooks beautiful food, it is a work of art and tastes delicious!

I came here yesterday in the late afternoon because we saw some great reviews on yelp and came here with a few friends and we ordered food and everything was pretty normal. But after waiting for 45mins we still didn&#39;t get any food or any drinks. We saw 3 tables who got their food before we did, even though we were there first.I decided to ask TONNY(waitress) what was going on as we sat right by the kitchen were the waiters pass by constantly. They said that the food was almost ready so we decided to wait. I was really patient with them and waited another 20minutes with no food! (Mind you this is a small restaurant) So I asked them to put it to go because I was running late for a paid event. It took them another 15minutes to give us the packed food and that was just about the only thing they did right.They gave us a check and we asked for a discount since we saw 3 other tables get served, paid, and leave. I also told them to take off the milkshake that we ordered because it never came. They told us don&#39;t worry we are already working on a discount and took our credit cards. 5 minutes later the bartender came out with a small plastic cup and gave us the milkshake saying I have a surprise for you! You would think they were giving that on the house but nope. They wanted to keep the $7 milkshake on our receipts. None of the staff took blame and they were cheap as hell trying to charge us for everything.In the end, after an hour and 45mins of nothing they came back and charged us full price for the food. I walked up to all the workers just standing there asking what is going on because I was in a huge rush and they promised a discount and all they did was point out the owner to me who was just standing there. They told me I would be getting a 30% discount and they didn&#39;t need the credit cards anymore.Today, We checked our statements and they have not given us the discount. I&#39;m not sure if this has to do anything about it, but we were the only nonblacks in there and my friends were wearing LGBT stuff. We were really patient with them especially cause our friends were from out of town and their first day in New York. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE.

After visiting 4 times in less than 10 days , this place has gone from bad to worse!! I have given it four chances as I thought it was new and they were just finding their feet, plus it was convenient as only a short distance from my house.I will keep it short .... As a female dining alone I was left waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement from two of the staff who walked straight past me twice, (there was only two table in at this time) after being told the key dishes were not available from the menu , I made a less enthusiastic choice from the remainder of the menu after the &#39;server&#39; could not recommend any dishes , the food came reasonably quickly , upon which I asked for some Mayo or sour cream , after my server walked around the resutuarnt filling waters and serving another table , upon a prompt from me I eventually got my dressing in a rather messy cup , I then asked what the desserts were which I was told. &#34;Cup cake or cookies&#34; to which I replied no cheesecake this evening ? (As I had previously had) she said&#34; yes baked or raw?&#34; So I requested baked. After 30 mins of waiting for said cheesecake, and yet another prompt I was delivered my much awaiting dessert, which looked/tasted completely different from my last visit , so after trying to get a servers attention away from their phones and sitting at the bar I asked another server what cheesecake this was to which he replied &#34;raw&#34; I stipulated this was not my request and he said they have no other although she had charged me for a baked cheesecake , this was taken away and off my bill, when I expressed my disappointment and continuous concerns front the min I arrived the serve just shrugged and walked off! So in short after various things too many to go into (blocked toilets , kitchen paper for toilet roll, and terrible terrible service) if you are looking for good food, good service and friendly environment then this is not the place for you, the main gentleman server has zero clue about service , I then find out that this business has been going for a while now so all the grace I gave it thinking they were new has now left a very bitter taste, the only reason this place is reasonably busy is because there is no other competition close by , but be prepared for long waits, awful service and over priced under whelming dishes (if they have any available ) there are a lot of easy fixes but lack of care or accountability !!!!

So we went.The List goes as followsFirst, we got our food before our water. Nuff said. Extremenly long wait for food...exceptionally Long. Like 45-minutes long.......WTF? Bad...just bad.Misleading Menu:Inaccurate descriptions of food. For Example, the juice had the consistency of a smoothie. The crawfish and seasoned vegetables were cooked in the same stew, adding no variation to the aesthetic appeal of the food, and reminded me of slop. Also, the menu didn&#39;t describe that there was cheese on the grits...that vegan velveeta-type cheese that was &#34;homemade&#34;...WHO TRAINED THESE PEOPLE. Your servers don&#39;t know what the food is made of or how it is made. If you don&#39;t know what it is made of, then simply say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. I felt like the menu items were extremely healthy and I didn&#39;t want to eat it at all...or extremely unhealthy and no one should probably eat it...Food Quality:Reminds me of Vegan Heart-attack slop, with no style.The Staff:Slow with their clean-up. There were tables in the restaurant that had dirty dishes on them for 20 minutes into us sitting down. We got our water after we got our food, which came 45 minutes into the meal. The waitress walked around with the debit card hanging out of the bill-fold for a few minutes, serving other customers instead of ringing the debit card on the machine, or even just securing it in a safe location by the register.Customers:The customers don&#39;t smile. Everyone looked upset, as if they were waiting way too long for their food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s true too. I saw two different accounts of customers returning their plates back to the kitchen, and one group of customers getting up to speak to management about the long wait and if there was anything they can make up real quick. Apparently, according to the manager &#34;everything is premade&#34;...really? So why does it take so long for the food to get to the customers table?How about the manager giving Lip to the customers? Speaking in a condescending tone, having an attitude about his own bad day. When me and my sis got home to look up the restaurant and reviews, we realized that this Dick-like Manager, was actually one of the Co-Owners. The son in the partnership. How could you...All in all, this place sucked and was a huge disappointment. I wish there were more vegan restaurants in Harlem. Seasoned Vegan is overly-salty, and sloppy. From their management, to their server, their food, and their clean-up process. I would never recommend this place, and will never be returning. I look forward to more vegan restaurants opening in Harlem. Please. Please.

Yes, I was curious and yes I went there extremely hungry in hopes that this would be an amazing meal! It was a Saturday evening...still early for a dinner rush so I thought this would be a quick and easy process to dine solo. I explained to my young waitress it was my first time there. She didn&#39;t seem too eager to explain anything or care to suggest any items. She just came back again and asked if I want to order? I finally chose the SV burger and asked if I can sub out the tomatoes for something else. I was told no. Even the vegan cheese was another $1-2 and extra for avocado. If I didn&#39;t get a topping, I basically got a bun with a soy patty. A bit stingy if you ask me. Even chips or fries on the side are not free. $16-17 bucks for a soy patty is a bit steep. Anyway, the order seem to take forever to complete. Like many other reviews listed below, the service was very off-putting. No one ever checked on me, refilled my water, or came back to ask if I wanted to order more. I literally had to wave my hands just to get water. They are not attentive at all! I finished my meal and sat with my hands folded for over 15 minutes and again no one ever stopped to ask if I wanted to order more or if they could bring the check. I did want to try dessert, but did not have the patience to wait for another long period just to order and then to pay. The service is what really ruins this place. Extremely frustrating! The burger was average. I might give it a second chance just to try some other menu items, but go early in the day. Perhaps when there are no other customers there, I might get some attention!!!

When I called back to ask the lady if she hung up or not she stated &#34;yeah I hung up&#34; because she supposedly couldn&#39;t hear me because, but after saying you heard me when i asked what time you guys close, she continued to say &#34; like I said I didn&#39;t hear you, I went on to say &#34; I&#39;m going to ask you again what time you guys close, and she finally stated the time.Its always our black establishments, that everyone seems to upset that they&#39;re taking orders etc, and they have to be at work. The customer service is horrible, and makes you not yant to eat there, but its one of the only places open late night besides IHOP in Harlem, and my first time at Amy Ruth&#39;s which people because we wanted to give it a try.When I arrived we were seated and our order was taken, the food came out in about 7 minutes.. I ordered catfish, Mac and cheese and collard greens. My friend ordered BBQ ribs/ chicken combo with Mac and cheese and corn. My catfish was salty and soggy, the greens were bland, and the Mac and cheese was cooked and topped with artificial cheese or a generic brand. I also ordered a peach mimosa which tasted like peaches mixed with orange soda, no alcohol in it. My friends ribs were chewy, over cooked, and the chicken was dry. I&#39;ve been to red rooster, Mannas, Silvia&#39;s all throughout Harlem and AMY RUTHS is by far the worse. Far from southern soul food, I am shocked people say this is the good food, but there aren&#39;t any good places to eat soul food anymore so people take what they can get Jacobs is better.Our waitress didn&#39;t ask us if we needed anything throughout the meal, if the food was good, if our glasses needed to be refilled... So after eating, I waited for someone to come over for about 15 minutes and no one came.. So I put my pointer finger up signaling for a waitress because all 6 or 7 of them were huddled on their cellphones at the counter. I made eye contact with one of the waitresses who then turned her head as if he didn&#39;t see us. When the waitress did come I said, I want the bill so I can go. She placed the bill on the table next to us instead of giving it to us directly, I paid and left.

The waiter assured him that it would be taken care of and that it was fine. We went back to our table and asked for the bill. 2 minutes later Joel the manager approaches us and asks us &#34;are ya good?&#34; We answer yes we&#39;re waiting to pay. Again a few minutes after he comes again and says he has to removed our glasses which we say okay that&#39;s fine we were already done... thank you.

I personally think because I am A GAY black male and mark is this &#34;Macho&#34; Caribbean black male, that he was surfing on BOARDERLINE HOMOPHOBIA.Mark likes to believe that he is this big guy that can intimidate people because of his muscular shape. Do not play into that. He wants to say he is doing this for the community... how it&#39;s all about &#34;his people&#34; but, how are you doing that if your charging $3 for a bottle of water? The guy in the hot dog truck infront of the shop charges $1 for the same thing? When lid or cups or anything as far a product would hit the floor mark would get really upset, if we threw them away. He would say &#34;That is wasteful, you could have still put them out&#34; or his favorite line &#34;If they don&#39;t know about them falling, how will it hurt them?&#34; with this stupid chuckle. Like whatttt!!!!! that&#39;s gross! Mark would get upset if you spoke up after he would talk down to us. When ever we would follow his rules, he would then turn it around on us like it is our fault. He suddenly would get amnesia and would say &#34;did I say that? I don&#39;t remember saying that.&#34; even though I would have text messages and emails of what was said. Everyone from the first team quit because mark did not enjoy the fact that we spoke up. The only person that is left is someone that basically would kiss up to mark (who spends most of his time on some gay hookup app name jack&#39;d). Whenever we spoke up mark would remove us off the working schedule. How can you play with someone&#39;s money like that? Three of the workers had children that they was taking care of as single parents. Mark did not care. if you had an opinion on something he would feel some kind of way about it. But what happen to freedom of speech? Is that thrown out the window once you enter his coffee shop?Mark doesn&#39;t care about his workers, Just about how he can use get the next sale.He wanted everyone to have there food safety license so he could go away on vacation, and his store would be safe. From when the store had opened, he went on vacation 3 times. that means he went on vacation once a month.. what kind of owner does that? When we got hired there was nothing stating that we needed to have our food safety licenses. Mark had gotten his AFTER the grand opening (How can you open a food establishment and not have your OWN Licenses and you are the OWNER!?) Marks words: &#34;I couldn&#39;t tell you guys to get yours when I don&#39;t have mind. Now that I have mine you all have 60 days to get it or you will be terminated.&#34; mmmhh such an amazing leader.Mark does nothing but spend his time swiping left or right on tinder. Hitting on the females that come in form time to time, Question people why don&#39;t they want to buy something, Eating his own product or sleeping in the back of the shop. When someone or something is important at the shop then he wants to be all hands on deck. The pay checks was also late. You want the employees to be on time for work but was late with the fund! where they do that at?!?I once ate a day old scone and had a small cup of tea. Mark is so money hungry that he made me pay for it. I threw it away and mark was upset.. a DAY OLD SCONE!I would think twice about the food there as the Bagels, Scones &amp; donuts are usually a day or two stale. Yes things do come in daily but they aren&#39;t put out unless they are not in stock to display. So when you are eating any of those thing listed, please take an extra look at your food before enjoying it. you wouldn&#39;t want the sandwich to have hold on it or anything. You would honestly have more of a better time at the stand that&#39;s is in front of the place.Again mark is not a nice person Literally the first group of staff all quit because mark was a shady person. Playing favorites with other staff, Talking down to us, Cursing and screaming at the staff meetings. Please don&#39;t let his Monkey type smile fool you.Hitler Installed fear in others, that what mark tried to do with his workers and from what I am reading, with some of the customers that come in to the shop.I will be responding with FACTS to all those bad reports on this place, because if u had a bad time just ordering and being within the space, imagine what it is like working there!", "Friendcount": "172", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 230}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "3", "Review ": "My almond croissant came to just under $6.

We couldn&#39;t have picked our spot any better!Our friend was here on a layover from a convention along with a colleague, and they were both deeply impressed. We felt like the knowledgeable New Yorkers we&#39;re supposed to be, ones know all the great new spots no one heard about yet. My friend and his colleague will now be able to boast they&#39;ve been to RDV long before any of their friends ever knew about it.The dishes were on point, every time. The portions are small, and our waiter probably should have recommended ordering breads and spreads to supplement the dishes, but otherwise the service was immaculate. Respectful and friendly, never condescending (like some of these French Bistros tend to be).Our 8 year old daughter couldn&#39;t get enough of the grilled octopus. She also picked the venison and the entrecote, and it was amazing to see her enjoy dishes she&#39;s not used to: she&#39;s not the pickiest eater but recently she&#39;s been reluctant to try new things. A dad can&#39;t be more proud than when seeing his daughter joyfully eat every single dish and ask for more!The chef (Kfir Ben-Ari) kept stopping by all the tables, speaking with his guests - some he knew, others were obviously there for the first time but he just made everyone feel so at home! This is no stuck up French Bistro. His human touch and his uncanny knack for social interaction (apparently he speaks 4 languages fluently..) made us feel like it&#39;s a communal space.That being said it&#39;s still a great place for a romantic dinner, and there were 2 couples in a corner that seemed really comfortable and happy in their own intimate space.I was mostly impressed with the attention to detail. Every dish looked like a work of art, and tasted even better. I loved the grilled octopus too, just like my daughter did, and the entrecote was perfectly made.I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try some of the rest of the dishes on my next visit: this is the type of place where you can easily try your luck: you will not be disappointed no matter what you pick, and you get to try things you&#39;ve never had before, prepared in the finest possible way and in the most creative possible way.We will be back with more friends, very soon!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 272}, {"Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "Chef Kfir cooks beautiful food, it is a work of art and tastes delicious!

I came here yesterday in the late afternoon because we saw some great reviews on yelp and came here with a few friends and we ordered food and everything was pretty normal. But after waiting for 45mins we still didn&#39;t get any food or any drinks. We saw 3 tables who got their food before we did, even though we were there first.I decided to ask TONNY(waitress) what was going on as we sat right by the kitchen were the waiters pass by constantly. They said that the food was almost ready so we decided to wait. I was really patient with them and waited another 20minutes with no food! (Mind you this is a small restaurant) So I asked them to put it to go because I was running late for a paid event. It took them another 15minutes to give us the packed food and that was just about the only thing they did right.They gave us a check and we asked for a discount since we saw 3 other tables get served, paid, and leave. I also told them to take off the milkshake that we ordered because it never came. They told us don&#39;t worry we are already working on a discount and took our credit cards. 5 minutes later the bartender came out with a small plastic cup and gave us the milkshake saying I have a surprise for you! You would think they were giving that on the house but nope. They wanted to keep the $7 milkshake on our receipts. None of the staff took blame and they were cheap as hell trying to charge us for everything.In the end, after an hour and 45mins of nothing they came back and charged us full price for the food. I walked up to all the workers just standing there asking what is going on because I was in a huge rush and they promised a discount and all they did was point out the owner to me who was just standing there. They told me I would be getting a 30% discount and they didn&#39;t need the credit cards anymore.Today, We checked our statements and they have not given us the discount. I&#39;m not sure if this has to do anything about it, but we were the only nonblacks in there and my friends were wearing LGBT stuff.

After visiting 4 times in less than 10 days , this place has gone from bad to worse!! I have given it four chances as I thought it was new and they were just finding their feet, plus it was convenient as only a short distance from my house.I will keep it short .... As a female dining alone I was left waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement from two of the staff who walked straight past me twice, (there was only two table in at this time) after being told the key dishes were not available from the menu , I made a less enthusiastic choice from the remainder of the menu after the &#39;server&#39; could not recommend any dishes , the food came reasonably quickly , upon which I asked for some Mayo or sour cream , after my server walked around the resutuarnt filling waters and serving another table , upon a prompt from me I eventually got my dressing in a rather messy cup , I then asked what the desserts were which I was told. &#34;Cup cake or cookies&#34; to which I replied no cheesecake this evening ? (As I had previously had) she said&#34; yes baked or raw?&#34; So I requested baked. After 30 mins of waiting for said cheesecake, and yet another prompt I was delivered my much awaiting dessert, which looked/tasted completely different from my last visit , so after trying to get a servers attention away from their phones and sitting at the bar I asked another server what cheesecake this was to which he replied &#34;raw&#34; I stipulated this was not my request and he said they have no other although she had charged me for a baked cheesecake , this was taken away and off my bill, when I expressed my disappointment and continuous concerns front the min I arrived the serve just shrugged and walked off! So in short after various things too many to go into (blocked toilets , kitchen paper for toilet roll, and terrible terrible service) if you are looking for good food, good service and friendly environment then this is not the place for you, the main gentleman server has zero clue about service , I then find out that this business has been going for a while now so all the grace I gave it thinking they were new has now left a very bitter taste, the only reason this place is reasonably busy is because there is no other competition close by , but be prepared for long waits, awful service and over priced under whelming dishes (if they have any available ) there are a lot of easy fixes but lack of care or accountability !!!!

So we went.The List goes as followsFirst, we got our food before our water. Nuff said. Extremenly long wait for food...exceptionally Long. Like 45-minutes long.......WTF? Bad...just bad.Misleading Menu:Inaccurate descriptions of food. For Example, the juice had the consistency of a smoothie. The crawfish and seasoned vegetables were cooked in the same stew, adding no variation to the aesthetic appeal of the food, and reminded me of slop. Also, the menu didn&#39;t describe that there was cheese on the grits...that vegan velveeta-type cheese that was &#34;homemade&#34;...WHO TRAINED THESE PEOPLE. Your servers don&#39;t know what the food is made of or how it is made. If you don&#39;t know what it is made of, then simply say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. I felt like the menu items were extremely healthy and I didn&#39;t want to eat it at all...or extremely unhealthy and no one should probably eat it...Food Quality:Reminds me of Vegan Heart-attack slop, with no style.The Staff:Slow with their clean-up. There were tables in the restaurant that had dirty dishes on them for 20 minutes into us sitting down. We got our water after we got our food, which came 45 minutes into the meal. The waitress walked around with the debit card hanging out of the bill-fold for a few minutes, serving other customers instead of ringing the debit card on the machine, or even just securing it in a safe location by the register.Customers:The customers don&#39;t smile. Everyone looked upset, as if they were waiting way too long for their food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s true too. I saw two different accounts of customers returning their plates back to the kitchen, and one group of customers getting up to speak to management about the long wait and if there was anything they can make up real quick. Apparently, according to the manager &#34;everything is premade&#34;...really? So why does it take so long for the food to get to the customers table?How about the manager giving Lip to the customers? Speaking in a condescending tone, having an attitude about his own bad day. When me and my sis got home to look up the restaurant and reviews, we realized that this Dick-like Manager, was actually one of the Co-Owners. The son in the partnership. How could you...All in all, this place sucked and was a huge disappointment. I wish there were more vegan restaurants in Harlem. Seasoned Vegan is overly-salty, and sloppy. From their management, to their server, their food, and their clean-up process. I would never recommend this place, and will never be returning.

Yes, I was curious and yes I went there extremely hungry in hopes that this would be an amazing meal! It was a Saturday evening...still early for a dinner rush so I thought this would be a quick and easy process to dine solo. I explained to my young waitress it was my first time there. She didn&#39;t seem too eager to explain anything or care to suggest any items. She just came back again and asked if I want to order? I finally chose the SV burger and asked if I can sub out the tomatoes for something else. I was told no. Even the vegan cheese was another $1-2 and extra for avocado. If I didn&#39;t get a topping, I basically got a bun with a soy patty. A bit stingy if you ask me. Even chips or fries on the side are not free. $16-17 bucks for a soy patty is a bit steep. Anyway, the order seem to take forever to complete. Like many other reviews listed below, the service was very off-putting. No one ever checked on me, refilled my water, or came back to ask if I wanted to order more. I literally had to wave my hands just to get water. They are not attentive at all! I finished my meal and sat with my hands folded for over 15 minutes and again no one ever stopped to ask if I wanted to order more or if they could bring the check. I did want to try dessert, but did not have the patience to wait for another long period just to order and then to pay. The service is what really ruins this place. Extremely frustrating!

I ordered catfish, Mac and cheese and collard greens. My friend ordered BBQ ribs/ chicken combo with Mac and cheese and corn. My catfish was salty and soggy, the greens were bland, and the Mac and cheese was cooked and topped with artificial cheese or a generic brand. I also ordered a peach mimosa which tasted like peaches mixed with orange soda, no alcohol in it. My friends ribs were chewy, over cooked, and the chicken was dry. I&#39;ve been to red rooster, Mannas, Silvia&#39;s all throughout Harlem and AMY RUTHS is by far the worse.

So I put my pointer finger up signaling for a waitress because all 6 or 7 of them were huddled on their cellphones at the counter.

The waiter assured him that it would be taken care of and that it was fine. We went back to our table and asked for the bill. 2 minutes later Joel the manager approaches us and asks us &#34;are ya good?&#34; We answer yes we&#39;re waiting to pay.

I personally think because I am A GAY black male and mark is this &#34;Macho&#34; Caribbean black male, that he was surfing on BOARDERLINE HOMOPHOBIA.Mark likes to believe that he is this big guy that can intimidate people because of his muscular shape. Do not play into that. He wants to say he is doing this for the community... how it&#39;s all about &#34;his people&#34; but, how are you doing that if your charging $3 for a bottle of water? The guy in the hot dog truck infront of the shop charges $1 for the same thing? When lid or cups or anything as far a product would hit the floor mark would get really upset, if we threw them away. He would say &#34;That is wasteful, you could have still put them out&#34; or his favorite line &#34;If they don&#39;t know about them falling, how will it hurt them?&#34; with this stupid chuckle. Like whatttt!!!!! that&#39;s gross! Mark would get upset if you spoke up after he would talk down to us. When ever we would follow his rules, he would then turn it around on us like it is our fault. He suddenly would get amnesia and would say &#34;did I say that? I don&#39;t remember saying that.&#34; even though I would have text messages and emails of what was said. Everyone from the first team quit because mark did not enjoy the fact that we spoke up. The only person that is left is someone that basically would kiss up to mark (who spends most of his time on some gay hookup app name jack&#39;d). Whenever we spoke up mark would remove us off the working schedule. How can you play with someone&#39;s money like that? Three of the workers had children that they was taking care of as single parents. Mark did not care. if you had an opinion on something he would feel some kind of way about it. But what happen to freedom of speech? Is that thrown out the window once you enter his coffee shop?Mark doesn&#39;t care about his workers, Just about how he can use get the next sale.He wanted everyone to have there food safety license so he could go away on vacation, and his store would be safe. From when the store had opened, he went on vacation 3 times. that means he went on vacation once a month.. what kind of owner does that? When we got hired there was nothing stating that we needed to have our food safety licenses. Mark had gotten his AFTER the grand opening (How can you open a food establishment and not have your OWN Licenses and you are the OWNER!?) Marks words: &#34;I couldn&#39;t tell you guys to get yours when I don&#39;t have mind. Now that I have mine you all have 60 days to get it or you will be terminated.&#34; mmmhh such an amazing leader.Mark does nothing but spend his time swiping left or right on tinder. Hitting on the females that come in form time to time, Question people why don&#39;t they want to buy something, Eating his own product or sleeping in the back of the shop. When someone or something is important at the shop then he wants to be all hands on deck. The pay checks was also late. You want the employees to be on time for work but was late with the fund! where they do that at?!?I once ate a day old scone and had a small cup of tea. Mark is so money hungry that he made me pay for it. I threw it away and mark was upset.. a DAY OLD SCONE!I would think twice about the food there as the Bagels, Scones &amp; donuts are usually a day or two stale. Yes things do come in daily but they aren&#39;t put out unless they are not in stock to display. So when you are eating any of those thing listed, please take an extra look at your food before enjoying it. you wouldn&#39;t want the sandwich to have hold on it or anything.

We couldn&#39;t have picked our spot any better!Our friend was here on a layover from a convention along with a colleague, and they were both deeply impressed. We felt like the knowledgeable New Yorkers we&#39;re supposed to be, ones know all the great new spots no one heard about yet. My friend and his colleague will now be able to boast they&#39;ve been to RDV long before any of their friends ever knew about it.The dishes were on point, every time. The portions are small, and our waiter probably should have recommended ordering breads and spreads to supplement the dishes, but otherwise the service was immaculate. Respectful and friendly, never condescending (like some of these French Bistros tend to be).Our 8 year old daughter couldn&#39;t get enough of the grilled octopus. She also picked the venison and the entrecote, and it was amazing to see her enjoy dishes she&#39;s not used to: she&#39;s not the pickiest eater but recently she&#39;s been reluctant to try new things. A dad can&#39;t be more proud than when seeing his daughter joyfully eat every single dish and ask for more!The chef (Kfir Ben-Ari) kept stopping by all the tables, speaking with his guests - some he knew, others were obviously there for the first time but he just made everyone feel so at home! This is no stuck up French Bistro. His human touch and his uncanny knack for social interaction (apparently he speaks 4 languages fluently..) made us feel like it&#39;s a communal space.That being said it&#39;s still a great place for a romantic dinner, and there were 2 couples in a corner that seemed really comfortable and happy in their own intimate space.I was mostly impressed with the attention to detail. Every dish looked like a work of art, and tasted even better. I loved the grilled octopus too, just like my daughter did, and the entrecote was perfectly made.I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try some of the rest of the dishes on my next visit: this is the type of place where you can easily try your luck: you will not be disappointed no matter what you pick, and you get to try things you&#39;ve never had before, prepared in the finest possible way and in the most creative possible way.We will be back with more friends, very soon!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 411}, {"Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "Chef Kfir cooks beautiful food, it is a work of art and tastes delicious!

I came here yesterday in the late afternoon because we saw some great reviews on yelp and came here with a few friends and we ordered food and everything was pretty normal. But after waiting for 45mins we still didn&#39;t get any food or any drinks. We saw 3 tables who got their food before we did, even though we were there first.I decided to ask TONNY(waitress) what was going on as we sat right by the kitchen were the waiters pass by constantly. They said that the food was almost ready so we decided to wait. I was really patient with them and waited another 20minutes with no food! (Mind you this is a small restaurant) So I asked them to put it to go because I was running late for a paid event. It took them another 15minutes to give us the packed food and that was just about the only thing they did right.They gave us a check and we asked for a discount since we saw 3 other tables get served, paid, and leave. I also told them to take off the milkshake that we ordered because it never came. They told us don&#39;t worry we are already working on a discount and took our credit cards. 5 minutes later the bartender came out with a small plastic cup and gave us the milkshake saying I have a surprise for you! You would think they were giving that on the house but nope. They wanted to keep the $7 milkshake on our receipts. None of the staff took blame and they were cheap as hell trying to charge us for everything.In the end, after an hour and 45mins of nothing they came back and charged us full price for the food. I walked up to all the workers just standing there asking what is going on because I was in a huge rush and they promised a discount and all they did was point out the owner to me who was just standing there. They told me I would be getting a 30% discount and they didn&#39;t need the credit cards anymore.Today, We checked our statements and they have not given us the discount. I&#39;m not sure if this has to do anything about it, but we were the only nonblacks in there and my friends were wearing LGBT stuff.

As a female dining alone I was left waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement from two of the staff who walked straight past me twice, (there was only two table in at this time) after being told the key dishes were not available from the menu , I made a less enthusiastic choice from the remainder of the menu after the &#39;server&#39; could not recommend any dishes , the food came reasonably quickly , upon which I asked for some Mayo or sour cream , after my server walked around the resutuarnt filling waters and serving another table , upon a prompt from me I eventually got my dressing in a rather messy cup , I then asked what the desserts were which I was told. &#34;Cup cake or cookies&#34; to which I replied no cheesecake this evening ? (As I had previously had) she said&#34; yes baked or raw?&#34; So I requested baked. After 30 mins of waiting for said cheesecake, and yet another prompt I was delivered my much awaiting dessert, which looked/tasted completely different from my last visit , so after trying to get a servers attention away from their phones and sitting at the bar I asked another server what cheesecake this was to which he replied &#34;raw&#34; I stipulated this was not my request and he said they have no other although she had charged me for a baked cheesecake , this was taken away and off my bill, when I expressed my disappointment and continuous concerns front the min I arrived the serve just shrugged and walked off! So in short after various things too many to go into (blocked toilets , kitchen paper for toilet roll, and terrible terrible service) if you are looking for good food, good service and friendly environment then this is not the place for you, the main gentleman server has zero clue about service , I then find out that this business has been going for a while now so all the grace I gave it thinking they were new has now left a very bitter taste, the only reason this place is reasonably busy is because there is no other competition close by , but be prepared for long waits, awful service and over priced under whelming dishes (if they have any available ) there are a lot of easy fixes but lack of care or accountability !!!!

Bad...just bad.Misleading Menu:Inaccurate descriptions of food. For Example, the juice had the consistency of a smoothie. The crawfish and seasoned vegetables were cooked in the same stew, adding no variation to the aesthetic appeal of the food, and reminded me of slop. Also, the menu didn&#39;t describe that there was cheese on the grits...that vegan velveeta-type cheese that was &#34;homemade&#34;...WHO TRAINED THESE PEOPLE. Your servers don&#39;t know what the food is made of or how it is made. If you don&#39;t know what it is made of, then simply say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. I felt like the menu items were extremely healthy and I didn&#39;t want to eat it at all...or extremely unhealthy and no one should probably eat it...Food Quality:Reminds me of Vegan Heart-attack slop, with no style.The Staff:Slow with their clean-up. There were tables in the restaurant that had dirty dishes on them for 20 minutes into us sitting down. We got our water after we got our food, which came 45 minutes into the meal. The waitress walked around with the debit card hanging out of the bill-fold for a few minutes, serving other customers instead of ringing the debit card on the machine, or even just securing it in a safe location by the register.Customers:The customers don&#39;t smile. Everyone looked upset, as if they were waiting way too long for their food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s true too. I saw two different accounts of customers returning their plates back to the kitchen, and one group of customers getting up to speak to management about the long wait and if there was anything they can make up real quick. Apparently, according to the manager &#34;everything is premade&#34;...really? So why does it take so long for the food to get to the customers table?How about the manager giving Lip to the customers? Speaking in a condescending tone, having an attitude about his own bad day. When me and my sis got home to look up the restaurant and reviews, we realized that this Dick-like Manager, was actually one of the Co-Owners. The son in the partnership. How could you...All in all, this place sucked and was a huge disappointment. I wish there were more vegan restaurants in Harlem. Seasoned Vegan is overly-salty, and sloppy. From their management, to their server, their food, and their clean-up process. I would never recommend this place, and will never be returning.

She didn&#39;t seem too eager to explain anything or care to suggest any items. She just came back again and asked if I want to order? I finally chose the SV burger and asked if I can sub out the tomatoes for something else. I was told no. Even the vegan cheese was another $1-2 and extra for avocado. If I didn&#39;t get a topping, I basically got a bun with a soy patty. A bit stingy if you ask me. Even chips or fries on the side are not free. $16-17 bucks for a soy patty is a bit steep. Anyway, the order seem to take forever to complete. Like many other reviews listed below, the service was very off-putting. No one ever checked on me, refilled my water, or came back to ask if I wanted to order more. I literally had to wave my hands just to get water. They are not attentive at all! I finished my meal and sat with my hands folded for over 15 minutes and again no one ever stopped to ask if I wanted to order more or if they could bring the check. I did want to try dessert, but did not have the patience to wait for another long period just to order and then to pay. The service is what really ruins this place. Extremely frustrating!

I personally think because I am A GAY black male and mark is this &#34;Macho&#34; Caribbean black male, that he was surfing on BOARDERLINE HOMOPHOBIA.Mark likes to believe that he is this big guy that can intimidate people because of his muscular shape. Do not play into that. He wants to say he is doing this for the community... how it&#39;s all about &#34;his people&#34; but, how are you doing that if your charging $3 for a bottle of water? The guy in the hot dog truck infront of the shop charges $1 for the same thing? When lid or cups or anything as far a product would hit the floor mark would get really upset, if we threw them away. He would say &#34;That is wasteful, you could have still put them out&#34; or his favorite line &#34;If they don&#39;t know about them falling, how will it hurt them?&#34; with this stupid chuckle. Like whatttt!!!!! that&#39;s gross! Mark would get upset if you spoke up after he would talk down to us. When ever we would follow his rules, he would then turn it around on us like it is our fault. He suddenly would get amnesia and would say &#34;did I say that? I don&#39;t remember saying that.&#34; even though I would have text messages and emails of what was said. Everyone from the first team quit because mark did not enjoy the fact that we spoke up. The only person that is left is someone that basically would kiss up to mark (who spends most of his time on some gay hookup app name jack&#39;d). Whenever we spoke up mark would remove us off the working schedule. How can you play with someone&#39;s money like that? Three of the workers had children that they was taking care of as single parents. Mark did not care. if you had an opinion on something he would feel some kind of way about it. But what happen to freedom of speech? Is that thrown out the window once you enter his coffee shop?Mark doesn&#39;t care about his workers, Just about how he can use get the next sale.He wanted everyone to have there food safety license so he could go away on vacation, and his store would be safe. From when the store had opened, he went on vacation 3 times. that means he went on vacation once a month.. what kind of owner does that? When we got hired there was nothing stating that we needed to have our food safety licenses. Mark had gotten his AFTER the grand opening (How can you open a food establishment and not have your OWN Licenses and you are the OWNER!?) Marks words: &#34;I couldn&#39;t tell you guys to get yours when I don&#39;t have mind. Now that I have mine you all have 60 days to get it or you will be terminated.&#34; mmmhh such an amazing leader.Mark does nothing but spend his time swiping left or right on tinder. Hitting on the females that come in form time to time, Question people why don&#39;t they want to buy something, Eating his own product or sleeping in the back of the shop. When someone or something is important at the shop then he wants to be all hands on deck. The pay checks was also late. You want the employees to be on time for work but was late with the fund! where they do that at?!?I once ate a day old scone and had a small cup of tea. Mark is so money hungry that he made me pay for it. I threw it away and mark was upset.. a DAY OLD SCONE!I would think twice about the food there as the Bagels, Scones &amp; donuts are usually a day or two stale. Yes things do come in daily but they aren&#39;t put out unless they are not in stock to display. So when you are eating any of those thing listed, please take an extra look at your food before enjoying it. you wouldn&#39;t want the sandwich to have hold on it or anything.

Playing favorites with other staff, Talking down to us, Cursing and screaming at the staff meetings. Please don&#39;t let his Monkey type smile fool you.Hitler Installed fear in others, that what mark tried to do with his workers and from what I am reading, with some of the customers that come in to the shop.I will be responding with FACTS to all those bad reports on this place, because if u had a bad time just ordering and being within the space, imagine what it is like working there!", "Friendcount": "172", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 508}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "3", "Review ": "My almond croissant came to just under $6.

We couldn&#39;t have picked our spot any better!Our friend was here on a layover from a convention along with a colleague, and they were both deeply impressed. We felt like the knowledgeable New Yorkers we&#39;re supposed to be, ones know all the great new spots no one heard about yet. My friend and his colleague will now be able to boast they&#39;ve been to RDV long before any of their friends ever knew about it.The dishes were on point, every time. The portions are small, and our waiter probably should have recommended ordering breads and spreads to supplement the dishes, but otherwise the service was immaculate. Respectful and friendly, never condescending (like some of these French Bistros tend to be).Our 8 year old daughter couldn&#39;t get enough of the grilled octopus. She also picked the venison and the entrecote, and it was amazing to see her enjoy dishes she&#39;s not used to: she&#39;s not the pickiest eater but recently she&#39;s been reluctant to try new things. A dad can&#39;t be more proud than when seeing his daughter joyfully eat every single dish and ask for more!The chef (Kfir Ben-Ari) kept stopping by all the tables, speaking with his guests - some he knew, others were obviously there for the first time but he just made everyone feel so at home! This is no stuck up French Bistro. His human touch and his uncanny knack for social interaction (apparently he speaks 4 languages fluently..) made us feel like it&#39;s a communal space.That being said it&#39;s still a great place for a romantic dinner, and there were 2 couples in a corner that seemed really comfortable and happy in their own intimate space.I was mostly impressed with the attention to detail. Every dish looked like a work of art, and tasted even better. I loved the grilled octopus too, just like my daughter did, and the entrecote was perfectly made.I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try some of the rest of the dishes on my next visit: this is the type of place where you can easily try your luck: you will not be disappointed no matter what you pick, and you get to try things you&#39;ve never had before, prepared in the finest possible way and in the most creative possible way.We will be back with more friends, very soon!", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 550}, {"Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "Chef Kfir cooks beautiful food, it is a work of art and tastes delicious!

I ordered catfish, Mac and cheese and collard greens. My friend ordered BBQ ribs/ chicken combo with Mac and cheese and corn. My catfish was salty and soggy, the greens were bland, and the Mac and cheese was cooked and topped with artificial cheese or a generic brand. I also ordered a peach mimosa which tasted like peaches mixed with orange soda, no alcohol in it. My friends ribs were chewy, over cooked, and the chicken was dry. I&#39;ve been to red rooster, Mannas, Silvia&#39;s all throughout Harlem and AMY RUTHS is by far the worse.

So I put my pointer finger up signaling for a waitress because all 6 or 7 of them were huddled on their cellphones at the counter.

I came here yesterday in the late afternoon because we saw some great reviews on yelp and came here with a few friends and we ordered food and everything was pretty normal. But after waiting for 45mins we still didn&#39;t get any food or any drinks. We saw 3 tables who got their food before we did, even though we were there first.I decided to ask TONNY(waitress) what was going on as we sat right by the kitchen were the waiters pass by constantly. They said that the food was almost ready so we decided to wait. I was really patient with them and waited another 20minutes with no food! (Mind you this is a small restaurant) So I asked them to put it to go because I was running late for a paid event. It took them another 15minutes to give us the packed food and that was just about the only thing they did right.They gave us a check and we asked for a discount since we saw 3 other tables get served, paid, and leave. I also told them to take off the milkshake that we ordered because it never came. They told us don&#39;t worry we are already working on a discount and took our credit cards. 5 minutes later the bartender came out with a small plastic cup and gave us the milkshake saying I have a surprise for you! You would think they were giving that on the house but nope. They wanted to keep the $7 milkshake on our receipts. None of the staff took blame and they were cheap as hell trying to charge us for everything.In the end, after an hour and 45mins of nothing they came back and charged us full price for the food. I walked up to all the workers just standing there asking what is going on because I was in a huge rush and they promised a discount and all they did was point out the owner to me who was just standing there. They told me I would be getting a 30% discount and they didn&#39;t need the credit cards anymore.Today, We checked our statements and they have not given us the discount. I&#39;m not sure if this has to do anything about it, but we were the only nonblacks in there and my friends were wearing LGBT stuff.

After visiting 4 times in less than 10 days , this place has gone from bad to worse!! I have given it four chances as I thought it was new and they were just finding their feet, plus it was convenient as only a short distance from my house.I will keep it short .... As a female dining alone I was left waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement from two of the staff who walked straight past me twice, (there was only two table in at this time) after being told the key dishes were not available from the menu , I made a less enthusiastic choice from the remainder of the menu after the &#39;server&#39; could not recommend any dishes , the food came reasonably quickly , upon which I asked for some Mayo or sour cream , after my server walked around the resutuarnt filling waters and serving another table , upon a prompt from me I eventually got my dressing in a rather messy cup , I then asked what the desserts were which I was told. &#34;Cup cake or cookies&#34; to which I replied no cheesecake this evening ? (As I had previously had) she said&#34; yes baked or raw?&#34; So I requested baked. After 30 mins of waiting for said cheesecake, and yet another prompt I was delivered my much awaiting dessert, which looked/tasted completely different from my last visit , so after trying to get a servers attention away from their phones and sitting at the bar I asked another server what cheesecake this was to which he replied &#34;raw&#34; I stipulated this was not my request and he said they have no other although she had charged me for a baked cheesecake , this was taken away and off my bill, when I expressed my disappointment and continuous concerns front the min I arrived the serve just shrugged and walked off! So in short after various things too many to go into (blocked toilets , kitchen paper for toilet roll, and terrible terrible service) if you are looking for good food, good service and friendly environment then this is not the place for you, the main gentleman server has zero clue about service , I then find out that this business has been going for a while now so all the grace I gave it thinking they were new has now left a very bitter taste, the only reason this place is reasonably busy is because there is no other competition close by , but be prepared for long waits, awful service and over priced under whelming dishes (if they have any available ) there are a lot of easy fixes but lack of care or accountability !!!!

So we went.The List goes as followsFirst, we got our food before our water. Nuff said. Extremenly long wait for food...exceptionally Long. Like 45-minutes long.......WTF? Bad...just bad.Misleading Menu:Inaccurate descriptions of food. For Example, the juice had the consistency of a smoothie. The crawfish and seasoned vegetables were cooked in the same stew, adding no variation to the aesthetic appeal of the food, and reminded me of slop. Also, the menu didn&#39;t describe that there was cheese on the grits...that vegan velveeta-type cheese that was &#34;homemade&#34;...WHO TRAINED THESE PEOPLE. Your servers don&#39;t know what the food is made of or how it is made. If you don&#39;t know what it is made of, then simply say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. I felt like the menu items were extremely healthy and I didn&#39;t want to eat it at all...or extremely unhealthy and no one should probably eat it...Food Quality:Reminds me of Vegan Heart-attack slop, with no style.The Staff:Slow with their clean-up. There were tables in the restaurant that had dirty dishes on them for 20 minutes into us sitting down. We got our water after we got our food, which came 45 minutes into the meal. The waitress walked around with the debit card hanging out of the bill-fold for a few minutes, serving other customers instead of ringing the debit card on the machine, or even just securing it in a safe location by the register.Customers:The customers don&#39;t smile. Everyone looked upset, as if they were waiting way too long for their food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s true too. I saw two different accounts of customers returning their plates back to the kitchen, and one group of customers getting up to speak to management about the long wait and if there was anything they can make up real quick. Apparently, according to the manager &#34;everything is premade&#34;...really? So why does it take so long for the food to get to the customers table?How about the manager giving Lip to the customers? Speaking in a condescending tone, having an attitude about his own bad day. When me and my sis got home to look up the restaurant and reviews, we realized that this Dick-like Manager, was actually one of the Co-Owners. The son in the partnership. How could you...All in all, this place sucked and was a huge disappointment. I wish there were more vegan restaurants in Harlem. Seasoned Vegan is overly-salty, and sloppy. From their management, to their server, their food, and their clean-up process. I would never recommend this place, and will never be returning. I look forward to more vegan restaurants opening in Harlem. Please. Please.

Yes, I was curious and yes I went there extremely hungry in hopes that this would be an amazing meal!

She didn&#39;t seem too eager to explain anything or care to suggest any items. She just came back again and asked if I want to order? I finally chose the SV burger and asked if I can sub out the tomatoes for something else. I was told no. Even the vegan cheese was another $1-2 and extra for avocado. If I didn&#39;t get a topping, I basically got a bun with a soy patty. A bit stingy if you ask me. Even chips or fries on the side are not free. $16-17 bucks for a soy patty is a bit steep. Anyway, the order seem to take forever to complete. Like many other reviews listed below, the service was very off-putting. No one ever checked on me, refilled my water, or came back to ask if I wanted to order more. I literally had to wave my hands just to get water. They are not attentive at all! I finished my meal and sat with my hands folded for over 15 minutes and again no one ever stopped to ask if I wanted to order more or if they could bring the check. I did want to try dessert, but did not have the patience to wait for another long period just to order and then to pay. The service is what really ruins this place. Extremely frustrating! The burger was average. I might give it a second chance just to try some other menu items, but go early in the day. Perhaps when there are no other customers there, I might get some attention!!!

I was very interested in going because it&#39;s only a short walk from my apartment. The food and our waiter were amazing.

When I went to the restroom with my brother the bathroom was clogged... typical situation at any NYC restaurant. My brother came out and apologized to the waiter because of the mess that he caused by flushing the already clogged toilet and tipped him because he knew someone had to clean it. He also offered to clean it himself since he also works in the restaurant industry and understands how annoying these situations can be. The waiter assured him that it would be taken care of and that it was fine. We went back to our table and asked for the bill. 2 minutes later Joel the manager approaches us and asks us &#34;are ya good?&#34; We answer yes we&#39;re waiting to pay. Again a few minutes after he comes again and says he has to removed our glasses which we say okay that&#39;s fine we were already done... thank you.

They yanked the bill from me and about 2 or 3 other workers come outside and start yelling at us. We&#39;re already out of the restaurant waiting to get a taxi to leave.

It won&#39;t be honored. I saw an interview on the news with the owner and read a piece in Essence magazine so I was intrigued. My aunt and uncle were coming into town and I thought this would be a great place to have dinner after their matinee show. I called three weeks in advance to make a reservation for Saturday, May 21, 2016. The first time I called one of the workers took my name and number and told me the night manager would call me back to book the reservation. Two days later when I still had not received the call back, I called again. Perhaps that should have been the first indication of things to come. However, the young man to whom I spoke was very pleasant and booked my reservation for four people on Saturday, May 21st at 5:30 pm. We arrived 5 minutes before and told my aunt and uncle to go inside while my husband and I found parking. When we returned less than 10 minutes later, we saw my aunt an uncle standing in the doorway. I thought it was because they would not seat us until the entire party arrived. It was also at this time that I learned just how small the restaurant is (this will be important later). I happen to like small, intimate restaurants so it didn&#39;t seem like it would be a big deal. The restaurant was packed and it didn&#39;t appear that any of the tables were close to finishing up their meals. So we waited . . . and we waited. After waiting a half hour I said to the young lady who I suppose was the manager for the night if she had any idea when we might be seated. She was pleasant enough but couldn&#39;t offer any real answers. She did share with me that the problem was a party of 20 was coming in. It didn&#39;t dawn on me that this party of 20 was about to be a huge problem for us. Fortunately, (I thought) there were a few tables that paid their respective checks and began to leave. At the same time, it appeared that members of the party of 20 had arrived for their 6:00 reservation. It was now about 6:10. The young manager said to me, I have to check to see how long it will take to get a table ready. That seemed odd to me because I was thinking, &#34;how long does it take to wipe down the table and chairs?&#34; I was wrong. Apparently, what was happening was an attempt to seat the party of 20 around the periphery of the restaurant. If you&#39;ve never been here you won&#39;t really understand this because again the restaurant is small. With respect to my party of four, the manager&#39;s solution was wait to see if one of the tables in the middle would empty out soon and seat us there. It was now 6:15 pm a full 45 minutes past our reservation time and more and more people were coming to the restaurant, I&#39;m not sure if they were members of the party of 20 or not but there was no space to hold all of the people who were waiting. At this point, it was clear that they were going to seat the party of 20 who had a 6:00 pm reservation and not seat my party of 4 for our 5:30 reservation. I&#39;m not one to make a huge scene but I let the manager know in no uncertain terms that the situation was unacceptable. Better training for the staff is definitely in order. In addition, it seems logical given the size of the restaurant, that if they are going to accommodate a party of 20, the restaurant should be closed to other patrons.

First off let me begin with Ive been in the hospitality industry for decades from theme restaurants, to mom &amp; pop shops, to upscale white gloves service type restaurants! I train staff every place I worked at because I know the importance of customer service, international hospitality steps of service and 100% customer retention!! So to say the least that is not what you get from Harlem Tavern! The staff looks unkempt as if they went out the night before, got smashed than made it to work just in time for the brunch shift! The place was barley crowded when I arrive shortly after 11am! I was greeted and sat promptly by the hostess (they were the best part of my experience) I was sat inside because I didn&#39;t have a seating preference. As I was seated a Busser came promptly over to water my glass,he spilled a majority of it on the menu and DID NOT WIPE IT OFF! I than watched an 8 minute YouTube video as I waited for a server to come great me! In those 8 mins I made direct eye contact with the bartenders who proceeded to converses with each other rather than check on me or even notify someone that a single guest was being ignored! Instead of leaving the Resturant entirely I went back to the host and told them I&#39;ve never been greeted! As I was headed to the host stand the actual waitress emerged and sorta shrugged when I walked from the table to the host ( so professional) I get a seat outside and waited about 5 more minutes before the waitress came by! When she did, she flatly stated &#34;what are you having&#34; I gave her my order and she left! About 6-7 minutes later my eggs Benedict and Bloody Mary arrived and I immediately asked for my check! The waiteress brought the check back moments later! No check back on how the food was or anything! I can see she is busy now but not to the point where you cannot give good service! I finished my meal and had my money waiting to pay she took another 6 mins before picking up the check and asked is that all!? I told her I needed change! She bought back the change, no receipt in the check presenter and scurried off to her next victims ( sorry guests)! All in al it wasn&#39;t even at the peak of brunch and service was dreadful!i feel sorry for any patrons who come to dine after me this morning! As I type this I have yet to even have a manger do a basic table check!my advise to anyone dinning here if you are looking to be ignored, looking to watch people serve you food while looking unkept than this is the place for you!

I got up to make room and the couple then change mind because it was too cramped (no kidding!) and I got up again. Then they needed the extra seats and we got up again for that. Then they brought over stools to replace chairs so I got up again. Finally they brought another couple who actually decided to sit so I got up again for that.

Oscar, the last head cook, is addicted to cocaine and a rapist. He attacked the young prep lady he tried to rape while on the job, no police report was filed, she was traumatized by this whole ordeal she was forced to quit. This all took place at Waltys home (It&#39;s disgusting) even the dishwasher/delivery guy is on drugs. Have one conversation with him &amp; you&#39;ll see. He has rotten teeth &amp; foul breath, also drinks on the job. It&#39;s not appropriate. I would suggest Josh actually take some initiative and be a little more involved and aware of the people he hires and trusts. It&#39;s only a matter of time before shit hits the fan. Hopefully he has all his ducks in order when the department of labor comes to pay them a visit as I reported my concerns to them.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again.

I could not have been more disappointed. I first ordered a Grey Goose martini with a twist of lemon. And waited. I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

I was in the process of taking it off anyway, but don&#39;t need to be treated like I&#39;m some kid in church! The muzak was so loud and obnoxious we had to shout at each other over it. Instead of setting a relaxed romantic intimate mood it was totally inappropriate for the place. No attempt was made for sound damping on otherwise hard walls and floors so it is loud, loud, loud, just from people talking over it! The food was okay but I thought $20 for a piece of fish with a little sauce over it and nothing else with it was a bit pricey!

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check. When I asked the manager about it, I just got a lot of babble about how they were not responsible about anything.Not the way to keep guests coming back.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container. Burger was good, cooked correctly and had nice flavor, served on a tasty potato roll.I&#39;m excited for this new addition to the neighborhood. This area has long been in need for a place like this.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again. We love Saggio and still want to support our local business.Here is an image of where we sat and next to a couple right against the wall.", "Friendcount": "14", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 37}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "Review ": "Is there a zero star option??

I was very pleased to see a new restaurant to the scene. I had ordered from here three times. And today is the last time I spent my hard earned money at Saggio.Firstly, it took them 88 minutes to get the food to me. When called to place the order, they say it would take 30 - 40 min. which was OK with me. Passed the hour mark, I called the restaurant and was assured that the food is on its way. It took another 28 minutes for me their delivery person to get to my building. Which is only 7 blocks away!! I was tired and just wanted to stay in and that&#39;s why I ordered for delivery.The food: our order was barely warm upon arrival. Black Linguini lacked the spicy - ness it used to have, and mushy. The grilled salmon was not grilled this time but pan fried and very dry. We had ordered the same dishes before so we can tell when it&#39;s not as good as before.The place, is going down hill fast in my view. The first time we ordered we got good food and fast. And with decent bread. The second time, two tiny pieces of bread, but everything seemed fine enough. And today, no bread, lukewarm food.The restaurant never offered me an apology, or even an acknowledgement of their screw up. The delivery person just shrugged and tell me it&#39;s not his problem.Sure it&#39;s new place in our hood, but do yourself a favor to spend your money elsewhere.

We also got the penne with tomato, basil, and parmesan, and added the sauteed vegetables. The tomato sauce tasted like a can of hunts tomato sauce, there was definitely no fresh basil, and the pieces of sauteed vegetables were about 3 inches long, and had to be put on a plate to be cut up.Another negative is that they only give the happy hour prices in the bar area.The only positive is that the service was really good.

I could not have been more disappointed. I first ordered a Grey Goose martini with a twist of lemon. And waited. I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check.

He also steals sake, &amp; drinks on the job, allows his friends &amp; hookups to eat free. He&#39;s usually loud &amp; very obnoxious, anywhere he is, it&#39;s hard not to notice him. Oscar, the last head cook, is addicted to cocaine and a rapist. He attacked the young prep lady he tried to rape while on the job, no police report was filed, she was traumatized by this whole ordeal she was forced to quit. This all took place at Waltys home (It&#39;s disgusting) even the dishwasher/delivery guy is on drugs. Have one conversation with him &amp; you&#39;ll see. He has rotten teeth &amp; foul breath, also drinks on the job. It&#39;s not appropriate. I would suggest Josh actually take some initiative and be a little more involved and aware of the people he hires and trusts. It&#39;s only a matter of time before shit hits the fan.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again.

I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container. Burger was good, cooked correctly and had nice flavor, served on a tasty potato roll.I&#39;m excited for this new addition to the neighborhood. This area has long been in need for a place like this.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again. We love Saggio and still want to support our local business.Here is an image of where we sat and next to a couple right against the wall.", "Friendcount": "14", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 297}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "Review ": "Is there a zero star option??

I was very pleased to see a new restaurant to the scene. I had ordered from here three times. And today is the last time I spent my hard earned money at Saggio.Firstly, it took them 88 minutes to get the food to me. When called to place the order, they say it would take 30 - 40 min. which was OK with me. Passed the hour mark, I called the restaurant and was assured that the food is on its way. It took another 28 minutes for me their delivery person to get to my building. Which is only 7 blocks away!! I was tired and just wanted to stay in and that&#39;s why I ordered for delivery.The food: our order was barely warm upon arrival. Black Linguini lacked the spicy - ness it used to have, and mushy. The grilled salmon was not grilled this time but pan fried and very dry. We had ordered the same dishes before so we can tell when it&#39;s not as good as before.The place, is going down hill fast in my view. The first time we ordered we got good food and fast. And with decent bread. The second time, two tiny pieces of bread, but everything seemed fine enough. And today, no bread, lukewarm food.The restaurant never offered me an apology, or even an acknowledgement of their screw up. The delivery person just shrugged and tell me it&#39;s not his problem.Sure it&#39;s new place in our hood, but do yourself a favor to spend your money elsewhere.

We also got the penne with tomato, basil, and parmesan, and added the sauteed vegetables. The tomato sauce tasted like a can of hunts tomato sauce, there was definitely no fresh basil, and the pieces of sauteed vegetables were about 3 inches long, and had to be put on a plate to be cut up.Another negative is that they only give the happy hour prices in the bar area.The only positive is that the service was really good.

I could not have been more disappointed. I first ordered a Grey Goose martini with a twist of lemon. And waited. I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check.

He also steals sake, &amp; drinks on the job, allows his friends &amp; hookups to eat free. He&#39;s usually loud &amp; very obnoxious, anywhere he is, it&#39;s hard not to notice him. Oscar, the last head cook, is addicted to cocaine and a rapist. He attacked the young prep lady he tried to rape while on the job, no police report was filed, she was traumatized by this whole ordeal she was forced to quit. This all took place at Waltys home (It&#39;s disgusting) even the dishwasher/delivery guy is on drugs. Have one conversation with him &amp; you&#39;ll see. He has rotten teeth &amp; foul breath, also drinks on the job. It&#39;s not appropriate. I would suggest Josh actually take some initiative and be a little more involved and aware of the people he hires and trusts. It&#39;s only a matter of time before shit hits the fan.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again.

I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning. In the meantime, maybe Yelp! will allow reviews with zero stars.", "Friendcount": "0", "coolvote": 0, "Usefulvote": 0, "funnyvote": 0, "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 1, "Id": 465}, {"Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "4", "Review ": "We took some out of town friends to Saggio last night and it was a terrible experience.

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check.

The owner wasn&#39;t around but I asked for my money back and they started itemizing my order. I asked for my money back including tip and they charged the delivery boy.

They just opened recently, so probably still trying to work out some kinks.

I&#39;m usually pretty loose on that kind of stuff but this is a new place so first impressions are everything.Place is small, but clean with a few seating options, all on stools (no tables). They rock Pat LaFrieda meat here, so right away you know what you are paying for ($4-6 burgers, a la carte). Ordered a few combo burgers with fries and and shakes ($12). Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container. Burger was good, cooked correctly and had nice flavor, served on a tasty potato roll.I&#39;m excited for this new addition to the neighborhood. This area has long been in need for a place like this. I can&#39;t overstate the similarities to shake shack (burger-wise, not on shakes). Not sure about delivery, but if they offer it, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll use it.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again.

I was tired and just wanted to stay in and that&#39;s why I ordered for delivery.The food: our order was barely warm upon arrival. Black Linguini lacked the spicy - ness it used to have, and mushy. The grilled salmon was not grilled this time but pan fried and very dry. We had ordered the same dishes before so we can tell when it&#39;s not as good as before.The place, is going down hill fast in my view. The first time we ordered we got good food and fast. And with decent bread. The second time, two tiny pieces of bread, but everything seemed fine enough. And today, no bread, lukewarm food.The restaurant never offered me an apology, or even an acknowledgement of their screw up.

I could not have been more disappointed. I first ordered a Grey Goose martini with a twist of lemon. And waited. I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

My fiance asked to celebrate his birthday here and so we invited friends along to a place where previously we had only had great experiences.Tonight was somewhat different.To begin with there were a couple of missed service points. We did not receive bread until well after we started getting food - and after we had to ask. We did not get any water refills, though the bottle on the table was emptied in the first 15 minutes we were there. Still we thought, &#34;It&#39;s Friday and they are busy.&#34; Minor things that we could have overlooked.Then a woman at the neighboring table was evidently quite upset about something. She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check. When I asked the manager about it, I just got a lot of babble about how they were not responsible about anything.Not the way to keep guests coming back.

Then my daughters came and we asked for a waiter to start us off with a bottle the wine and appetizer while we wait for another guest.

He also steals sake, &amp; drinks on the job, allows his friends &amp; hookups to eat free. He&#39;s usually loud &amp; very obnoxious, anywhere he is, it&#39;s hard not to notice him. Oscar, the last head cook, is addicted to cocaine and a rapist. He attacked the young prep lady he tried to rape while on the job, no police report was filed, she was traumatized by this whole ordeal she was forced to quit. This all took place at Waltys home (It&#39;s disgusting) even the dishwasher/delivery guy is on drugs. Have one conversation with him &amp; you&#39;ll see. He has rotten teeth &amp; foul breath, also drinks on the job. It&#39;s not appropriate.

Both shake options I attempted to order they were out of, (really?...bummer). And, they were out or regular fries (really?....) So, I received sweet potato fries instead. I can live with that.Food arrived. Shakes were in what looks to be a 12-16 oz style cup (to go) but was instead filled up no more than 10oz? Was surprised. My fries were not very warm, but tasted good. I must have missed a condiment counter/area to go - only received ketchup in a container.

But your manager Lisa would not give me an email address to send a note and told me &#34;to find the contact info on my own&#34; She literally left us no choice but to do so.I am a neighborhood local that has been coming to your establishment the last couple years. We typically dine in at least 2 times a months and order in weekly. I have always had a pleasant experience with the exception of this weekend and again last night. All due to your Manager Lisa.Started with Sunday when I came for a solo brunch and had a starbucks (for my husband) that I was taking home. She was abrupt upon entry and rudely let me know that i can not drink outside drinks. I tried to explain that this was a to go cup for my husband and I was coming for brunch on my own. She proceeded to go on rudely that i need to leave it at the bar or I cant dine in the restaurant. I adhered to it and left it at the bar , enjoyed my brunch and went on about my day after she rudely yet again handed off the coffee and didn&#39;t even acknowledge me in any way.I didn&#39;t allow my sour experience with her to deter me from coming back last night with my niece, who is in town on her first NYC visit and hungry to enjoy one of our favorite restaurants in our hood. Upon entry at 915pm, I could already sense her lack of excitement to see me back and was yet again met rudely. She did not greet us and walked us over to the 2 top right next to the stairs. I asked if we could have a 4 top considering the restaurant was empty and nearing closing time on a rainy Tuesday. She bluntly and rudely said no and gave us the option of the 2 top in the hallway leading to the garden as an alternative. I tried to reason with her and explain I need the space considering I recently (as in last Friday) had surgery and simply asked for a 4 top since the restaurant was empty and I could be comfortable. Mind you - there were 2 people at the bar , 1 couple at the high top , and 3 parties on the main dinning floor , all finishing up their meals. A total of 4 , four tops were not occupied. Not ONE SOUL walked in after us and by the time we left at 1030pm.Being that she gave us only 2 options , I opted to sit at a 2 top that I could see in front of me and which happens to be right next to another couple who was leaving. As I was headed to the restroom I asked her for the name of the owner since she was being so rude as a manager and representative of the restaurant that we love in the hood. She refused to give it. I got frustrated and told her I didn&#39;t appreciate her rudeness and I would like the name of the owner and email to send a note about our horrible experience. I proceeded to let her know that i asked for a 4 top because of my condition and seeing that the restaurant was empty. She proceeded to let me know that i had options of 2 tops but she would not give me a 4 top because of a &#34;Rush&#34; that was bound to happen on a Tuesday at 930pm!!! She literally walked to the edge of the stairs making a scene and pointing at all the tables as I stood at the stand keeping my voice low and while she raised her voice. She then went on to say I could leave and she didn&#39;t need our business. I was shocked at her response for simply asking for her name and or the owners email. She proceeded to write her name on a paper and the website. I explained I needed the email and she said &#34;You can look it up yourself on the site&#34;I have never had this kind of experience at Saggio. I OPTED to stay so my niece could enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants and still enjoy the service of the great WAIT STAFF (which was still exceptional btw).But I will say - if this manager is the face of your establishment in the owners absence, then I have to make sure to protect my time , my wallet and spend my money elsewhere and let anyone else know to steer clear. She made my nieces first experience a horrible one at first. I am beyond disappointed. She continued through the evening and as we were leaving to give us dirty looks and yet again ignore us and not thank us for our patronage.Hope you work with her on her managerial and customer service skills to avoid these kind of encounters again.

I was very pleased to see a new restaurant to the scene. I had ordered from here three times. And today is the last time I spent my hard earned money at Saggio.Firstly, it took them 88 minutes to get the food to me. When called to place the order, they say it would take 30 - 40 min. which was OK with me. Passed the hour mark, I called the restaurant and was assured that the food is on its way. It took another 28 minutes for me their delivery person to get to my building. Which is only 7 blocks away!! I was tired and just wanted to stay in and that&#39;s why I ordered for delivery.The food: our order was barely warm upon arrival. Black Linguini lacked the spicy - ness it used to have, and mushy. The grilled salmon was not grilled this time but pan fried and very dry. We had ordered the same dishes before so we can tell when it&#39;s not as good as before.The place, is going down hill fast in my view. The first time we ordered we got good food and fast. And with decent bread. The second time, two tiny pieces of bread, but everything seemed fine enough. And today, no bread, lukewarm food.The restaurant never offered me an apology, or even an acknowledgement of their screw up. The delivery person just shrugged and tell me it&#39;s not his problem.Sure it&#39;s new place in our hood, but do yourself a favor to spend your money elsewhere.

I could not have been more disappointed. I first ordered a Grey Goose martini with a twist of lemon. And waited. I was morbidly distracted by the hipster couple and their unaccountably beautiful children at the table opposite eat their pasta, adults included, with their fingers. Eventually the waitress took my food order, the polenta with broccoli rabe and gorgonzola appetizer and the pappardelle with lamb ragu entree, both specials. The polenta arrived first, a huge bowl of the blandest mush imaginable (the chef seemed unacquainted with salt or flavoring of any kind), a wisp of broccoli rabe and, I do not jest, a FROZEN, not chilled, FROZEN ball of gorgonzola. I&#39;d planned to order a glass of wine for the entree, but as the martini didn&#39;t arrive until AFTER the entree, I decided otherwise, particularly since the waitress didn&#39;t give me a chance to ask. The martini was served in a wine glass and if there was vodka, let alone Grey Goose, in the glass, I certainly didn&#39;t taste it or feel it, making me wonder if it had been a seltzer with lemon, gone flat, abandoned at the bar. I almost said something, but didn&#39;t want to make a scene and, besides, whatever was in the food apparently rendered me invisible. Meanwhile, about the entree: a good ragu takes hours to prepare and it&#39;s nice if the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, but this had been sitting around, if not having been defrosted from a previous date, long enough to turn into a congealed mess. It&#39;s predominant flavor was acidic, lemon or vinegar, or both. Why one would or how one could cover up the taste of tomatoes and lamb is a mystery. The gelati were okay, the espresso as bad as anywhere else. Although disapponted, I was willing to consider returning and ordering off the regular menu - it&#39;s a new place, give it another chance, maybe it was an off night, maybe the specials were anomalously bad. However, the coup de grace was when paying with my credit card, it was returned with (2) receipts, one for my meal, the other for another party for over $300. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she claimed it must have been a &#34;computer error&#34;, offering no apology. The owner or manager came over 10 minutes later and reiterated the &#34;computer error&#34; rather than simply admitting that someone had mistakenly run my card through twice, again with no apology whatsoever and not even the grace or hospitality skills to comp the espresso or bring over an after dinner drink for having me sit there for 20 minutes while waiting for them to correct their mess. I did not complain and had been quiet and respectful the entire time, but I began to wonder if they didn&#39;t want my business. When I got home, I immediately called my credit card company. It took over a week before the restaurant straightened things out with Visa. When Hell freezes over like that ball of gorgonzola, perhaps I&#39;ll consider the possibility of returning.

She threw a glass against the wall - showering both her table and ours with shards of broken glass - and left in a huff.I know this was not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. However, the management&#39;s response to it is. No one ever came over to check on us to make sure we were ok. We had to ask our waiter to take away the just delivered paella that was now glass laden. Our glasses of sangria, now also contaminated with broken glass were left on the table. Had I been the manager, I would have made sure that we didn&#39;t drink from them - a guest that leaves with a shard of glass in them could run up quite the medical expenses that the restaurant could be held liable for.When we just asked to be given the check and leave, while the paella was taken off, our now undrinkable sangria was still on the check.

What was supposed to be a nice Sunday afternoon meal turned into one of the most stressful brunch experiences I&#39;ve ever had.We walked in at 12:05. We were seated immediately, and since we were hungry due to mild hangovers, we ordered our drinks and food right away.Then we noticed a large group of about 25 people seated in the back. They were extremely rude and inconsiderate; you couldn&#39;t help but stare at them and be ashamed for humanity. They were constantly ordering the waitresses around, admonishing them in front of customers, and applauding sarcastically when the food was brought out. It seemed that there was only one person serving food and the restaurant was understaffed. We really felt for the waitresses, who all seemed to be working hard.But our feelings of sympathy gradually dissipated as we waited...and waited...and waited. After about an hour, one of my friends approached the manager (or who we thought was the manager) and asked her about our order. During the entire hour, no one came to update us on the status or apologize for the long wait. Granted, they were taking care of the large, rude group, but still. Others in the restaurant were becoming increasingly frustrated as well.Finally, after my friend spoke with the manager, our food arrived. It was nothing to write home about, but at least it was warm and they got the order right.What prompted me to write this review was the fact that our bill came out to $58 (excluding tip), and we noticed that they had the gall to add the gratuity, which they calculated as $12.60. Not only is this more than 20%, it was never mentioned on the menu that the tip would be included. We didn&#39;t want to tip more than 20%, especially after waiting for our food for over an hour while being completely ignored by the staff. We actually had to tell the manager that the tip was too much.After saying gratuity is automatically added on weekends with parties of &#34;more than 4&#34; (there were just 4 of us) and that all they do is &#34;press a button to calculate the tip,&#34; the &#34;manager for the day&#34; told us that &#34;someone jacked my calculator&#34; and that&#39;s why the mistake was made. Yeah, okay. We ended up having to tip the 20% for the crappy service and an inattentive staff and wondered how many customers they duped into tipping more than 20%.The entire experience eating there on the whole was appalling, frustrating, and ridiculous.
