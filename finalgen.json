[{"Review ": "I had just binged all weekend on booze, and was about to indulge in a Sunday Funday. I needed some sort of food, and wanted it to be healthy. This was the closest thing to Penn Station I could find... so the location is key.I couldn&#39;t decide what to get, so the friendly baristas were able to help me decide and were knowledgeable about the food. I got the kale/avocado egg white omelette...I didn&#39;t even know avocado could be in an omelette, but at this point I don&#39;t know if I can ever have an omelette the same again. The serving was massive, fresh, fluffy, and was by far the best omelette I ever got. I also got a fresh juice (Saw them make it in front of me) and got all my nutrients before I went for a day of shots (sorry I&#39;m not sorry).The decor is relaxed, bright, rustic, earthy... but still feels like a chic NYC place. The service is exceptional. My only negative is that the price is high... but then again its NYC, so its likely on par with evertyhing else.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "608", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "242", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "124", "Review_length": 186}, {"Review ": "This place WAS my go-to health conscious breakfast spot for the last 2 months.They offer a good variety of fresh vegetable juices. They will also accommodate you if you want to make your own juice and not order from the juice list they suggest. They also sell smoothies.The staff is friendly and go the extra mile to learn the customers names.I started this review off on a high note because I&#39;ve been avoiding writing this part.One morning I decided to switch it up because I wanted to get a sandwich. I was craving a bacon egg and cheese but I&#39;m trying to stay away from eating those sammys every morning.I remembered that this place not only had a great juice list but they sold sandwiches so I decided to order an avocado toast platter (it comes with a side of eggs).I enjoyed the first half of my toast, it was closed into a sandwich by the way which was fine but when I went to bite down on the 2nd half of my sandwich I noticed something weird. It was a hair. A freaking hair.I was shocked. I pulled it out and it definitely was inside of the sandwich and didn&#39;t fall from me or someone around me. Sigh. I threw the rest of the platter away. I was turned off completely and haven&#39;t been back since.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "125", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "205", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "2", "No_of_Photos": "329", "Review_length": 227}, {"Review ": "I went Juicology around lunchtime on a weekday, and luckily, it wasn&#39;t super busy at all which was amazing for a hustle and grind place like New York City. I was in the mood to try one of their many acai bowls! When ordering, I asked which was their most popular one, and they suggested that I try their Purple Evil Minion acai bowl which consisted of organic acai juice, acai berries, peanut butter, banana, and homemade granola for $9.25. I saw that if you checked into Yelp, they would also throw in a free small coffee!At the back of the juice bar, they had a seating area with a few tables. There was also a restroom available which was actually pretty nice. This is a rare thing for New York City, so it felt like a comfortable place for me to hang out at. When the acai bowl and coffee was ready, they called me out, and gave me a tray that I brought back to the seating area.The acai bowl was delicious. It tasted freshly-made, and after my first bite, I was very impressed with the addition of the peanut butter. I have never had peanut butter mixed in with acai before! I have had many acai bowls in my lifetime, but this Purple Evil Minion one was very unique. I would definitely recommend it. The coffee was okay, nothing fancy.Overall, I really liked this place. Their service was friendly, it was comfortable, clean, not overly-crowded during lunchtime, and they had really good acai bowls! It doesn&#39;t taste prepared-beforehand like other places.

The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called). It literally tasted like protein and it was VERY starchy. No sweetness and felt as though it wasn&#39;t complete. For $10, I expected a lot more.2. My friend ordered a coffee smoothie and had a similar problem with mine. I tried his, and also thought it tasted terrible.3. I ordered the ginger cayenne lemon shots as well.

The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4.

Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own. I&#39;ve only had it once, maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned enough that one time I had it... or maybe it is supposed to be that way.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "144", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "65", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "100", "Review_length": 430}, {"Review ": "This place reminded me of the soup nazi place Seinfeld.

The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned.

The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema.

The portion is extremely large with broth right up to the brim. Meanwhile there are nowhere near enough noodles etc to match.

The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly.

As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before.

Mighty Mushroom Roll (8 pcs about 3/4&#34; thick and between a quarter and half dollar in diameter). Shiitake Mushrooms, tofu, enoki, micro arugula, wrapped in a purple 6 grain rice wrap, a little squeeze tube of mushroom teriyaki puree, ginger, wasabi, soy packet. Pickle Me Rolls (similar 8 pcs) carrot, daikon, avocado, squeeze tube of carrot ginger puree.All came within 10-15 minutes topps for just shy of $20. Very tasty, wasabi cleared my sinuses right away.

The flavors weren&#39;t over powering. You get the fennel in the after taste. I didnt really notice the almond pesto. The rice is slightly harder than the traditional.The badge dumplings: i actually like the filling very much. But 2 of my 4 dumplings were not sealed well, so I could just open it up like a taco. The sauce is nicely paired but was heavy handed on my dish.Blackberry lemonade: super disappointed. It was like watered down lemonade.Seating: large dine in area which is unusual for the area. A small bar table by the front window for those here for a quick bite.Def not a place for those with a big appetite. At about $6 avg for a dish, it addes up to be pretty pricy after all is said and done.Overall I would say its not a bad place to grab a healthy snack.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The panini itself was nice and crispy on the outside despite it taking another 30minutes for me to get to work and enjoy it. The tomato, lettuce and prosciutto tasted fresh and the mayo was light. It would make for a filling meal any day.The ice coffee seemed like your regular deli coffee at first but it packs a good caffeine kick in it. And I also appreciate the fact that some of the ice cubes are actually frozen coffee cubes so the coffee doesn&#39;t feel as watered down as the other ice melts.Overall the meal was not &#34;mind-blowing&#34; but it is a good option if you are looking for a regular lunch place near your office with consistently good, healthy options.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "6", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "1", "Review_length": 175}, {"Review ": "For a tiny little joint, this place won&#39;t disappoint !!Great Paninis made with Love.The owner positive and friendly attitude alone is a real pleasure !", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "32", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "62", "Review_length": 25}, {"Review ": "If I could give 0 stars, I would.As if the self portraits on the wall aren&#39;t enough to define this self-absorbed narcissist called Jonny, the service is just as gut wrenching.I have been to JP&#39;s previously and always enjoy my usual panini - #17 caprese, no basil pesto substituted with chimichurri. The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences.

Korean food is my favorite, and the idea of a Korean Chipotle-style restaurant was exciting! I went there finally, and my excitement quickly faded.I went to Purple Rice after work before going to an event and the first thing I noticed was it was quite spacious, which was nice. When I was deciding what to get, the staff kind of just stood there and was not helpful at all. I feel like they didn&#39;t even know anything about Korean food. This was confirmed when I asked for tteok-bokki and they didn&#39;t know what I was asking for, even though it is written on their menu.I ended up ordering kimchi fried rice with crispy chicken, bulgolgi, and tteok-bokki at a cost of $13.00. What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking. Purple Rice is taking advantage of the fact that Koreatown is not that close because if this were near any restaurant there, nobody would ever eat here.

If there were half stars, I would probably give this a 4.5, since there are some Korean spots where I like the food better, but rounding up instead of down because there isn&#39;t a lot of affordable and customizable Korean fast casual in the city. I like that this fills that niche.For our first visit, the bowl seemed like the best option. For $9.95 pre-tax, you get a base plus 2 toppings. The base could be white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, or japchae. Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got. Pretty happy with the choices.I would definitely go back to Purple Rice to try more of the entrees and options.

Boxes are a base plus three entrees and bowls are base plus two entrees. The base consists of white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, and japchae (sweet potato noodles). Entrees are varied - there&#39;s pork, chicken, tofu, rice cakes, etc.I ordered japchae base bowl with spicy pork and dukbokki (spicy rice cake) and got a small side of kimchi jiggae soup (~$5). Everything was really good. The spicy pork was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The dukbokki was a little sweet, but delicious - spicy, soft. The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow! K town kimchi jiggae can be up to $15 (the tax and tip when you sit down), but as Purple Rice is a grab and go, for $5 small or $10 large - it&#39;s perfect price and better quality. The manager last night said that it takes about 2 weeks to make their kimchi in-house. The soup is authentic and it&#39;s worth a try.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar).

I came by around early evening and was surprised how many baked goods they still had in stock (however, on another night, this wasn&#39;t the case).Anyways, I wasn&#39;t in the mood for overly sweet things so I ended up getting the apple cider cake donut which sounded different, but not over the top crazy like some of the other cool sounding flavors here. I also considered the cinnamon snail, but it looked too sweet for my tastes at the time.I didn&#39;t think someone could mess up a cake donut, until now. It definitely tasted a couple days old because it was really dried out. Maybe the summer heat got to it despite being indoors?

It&#39;s an ancho chili seitan burger grilled in maple hickory bbq sauce with jalapeno mac n cheese, arugula, smoked chili coconut bacon &amp; chipotle mayo on a grilled pretzel bun. I ordered mine on a bed of quinoa and greens instead of the bun,mostly because I didn&#39;t want each bite to be a mess. Sometimes, forks are better. This burger truly was the best of it all thanks to the dollop of jalapeno mac n&#39; cheese. So delish! I would definitely recommend this.I had hoped to have room left for a doughnut or some other baked delectable, but it didn&#39;t work out that way. The serving was huge.

It was everything I anticipated, and then some.The Cinnamon Snail is located inside of the Pennsy, which offers a collection of order-at-counter shops. Everything from meats, seafood, a bar, etc. Cinnamon Snail is the only full-vegan shop inside of the Pennsy. You order and then sit inside the shared space within the Pennsy, almost like a high-end cafeteria. As a vegan dating a non-vegan, we really valued this set up since we each got to get the food we preferred, but still sit and eat together. The interior was aesthetically pleasing, lit up with beautiful natural lighting.The servers at the counter of the cinnamon snail were very friendly and welcoming. They were attentive to my questions and answered appropriately.I ordered the beast mode burger and the raspberry cheesecake donut. The food menu is minimal, so I had a somewhat easy time choosing the burger. But the sweets selection is so extensive that I had a difficult time just choosing one item. I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for. The pretzel bun took everything to another level.Prices were on the higher end ($11.02 burger, $3.50 donut) but I suppose I can justify it with 1) The burger was soo filling and 2) artisanal donut. I guess it depends on who you&#39;re asking.My only gripe maybe would be the wait time, but since I arrived right at opening, I didn&#39;t face that issue. But after sitting and observing the line for an hour, The Cinnamon Snail was constantly the longest line inside of the Pennsy.

The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called).

The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4.

The layout of the store is a little confusing, as it&#39;s not super clear where you line up to ORDER the bagel, and then where you go to pay for the bagel/order any additional drinks. Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place! Even on a Tuesday morning, there was frequent customers coming in to grab their bagels and the store was definitely bustling.

When I opened the lid of the takeout container, the hypnotic aroma of truffle oil washed over me, and I knew that I was really going to enjoy this. I fought through my fear of burning my tongue so I could devour this cassone, which is a testament to how good it smelled. It was totally worth it.

The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said &#34;i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?&#34; So I deconstructed a piece of the second half. There was a small amount of chicken, but it looked shredded, just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn&#39;t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich.This place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner.

Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own. I&#39;ve only had it once, maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned enough that one time I had it... or maybe it is supposed to be that way.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "144", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "65", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "100", "Review_length": 430}, {"Review ": "This place reminded me of the soup nazi place Seinfeld.

The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema. Come by the next time you have something to do in Penn, or MSG.The last time I came here, there seemed to be a card minimum, but I think it has since been dropped?

This is the quintessential NY slice that you have to give your friends, your family, your distant cousins from Kentucky who think they know what pizza is, your friends from afar who have underestimate American ingenuity, and even that homeless guy you want to help out cause everyone should have this pizza.Their staff is friendly and quick! I was lucky enough that they gave me an extra free slice of plain to make way for a new fresh pie. That&#39;s how fresh their pizza is. Their sauce is less acidic than typical marinara but not too sweet like many canned sauces. The crust is durable and withstands the fold test like a champ. No drooping. No sag.

I perused the menu on my last visit and it sounded like they had some excellent stuff on there.My favorite items on the menu are as follows:- all the dumplings, but The Badge in particular- the nutty buddy rice paper wrap- the coconut curry soup- the spicy mang sushi rollI&#39;d have to say that I don&#39;t really rate the ramen/noodle soups on the menu - I think that item still needs perfecting. The portion is extremely large with broth right up to the brim. Meanwhile there are nowhere near enough noodles etc to match. I think the broth needs to be reduced a lot and the noodles etc increased a little. I didn&#39;t really rate the red miso one I tried or the chili mushroom (not a lot of flavor). Also, I didn&#39;t find the chili mushroom that spicy despite numerous warnings from staff.Thanks again Beyond Sushi.

It is a full service, sit down location, in addition to take out. Beyond Sushi&#39;s 100% vegan menu has really expanded since they first started, and it&#39;s all amazing! The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited (off peak hours), but it definitely was speedy and attentive service here. The decor was beautiful- clean, simple and spacious. Plenty of seating.The food here is always fresh and made to order. Special attention is given to presentation and plating, making the food look even more appetizing. Sushi rolls here are colorful and unique! Don&#39;t expect your average avocado roll. You would not be able to find plant-based rolls like Beyond Sushi anywhere else.For this visit, I tried the seasonal roll, with Korean sweet potato filling. Really yummy! As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before. They are not trying to imitate meat/ fish, but trying to highlight PLANT foods. Prices are reasonable, especially for vegan food.

It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m easily persuaded, because The Badge was a delightful appetizer. The dumpling features charred cabbage, onion, garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and sesame oil topped with chili panko, cilantro, and ponzu sauce.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day).

When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences. They took them down due to these threats, so don&#39;t be fooled by the 5 star reviews.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "17", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "24", "Friendcount": "5", "funnyvote": "9", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 665}, {"Review ": "The paninis here are exactly what they&#39;re like in Italy.

What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking.

Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got. Pretty happy with the choices.I would definitely go back to Purple Rice to try more of the entrees and options. Really great having such a convenient fast casual spot like this when you don&#39;t feel like having a full meal in K-Town.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "77", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "4", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "135", "Review_length": 269}, {"Review ": "It&#39;s a great new lunch/dinner spot in midtown! I&#39;ve been wanting to come to this place since it opened up and finally had a chance to last night. Interior is really clean and actually very large - there&#39;s a ton of seating and also easy to takeout.The menu is simple - you can choose a box (~$13) or a bowl (~$10). Boxes are a base plus three entrees and bowls are base plus two entrees. The base consists of white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, and japchae (sweet potato noodles). Entrees are varied - there&#39;s pork, chicken, tofu, rice cakes, etc.I ordered japchae base bowl with spicy pork and dukbokki (spicy rice cake) and got a small side of kimchi jiggae soup (~$5). Everything was really good. The spicy pork was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The dukbokki was a little sweet, but delicious - spicy, soft. The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow! K town kimchi jiggae can be up to $15 (the tax and tip when you sit down), but as Purple Rice is a grab and go, for $5 small or $10 large - it&#39;s perfect price and better quality. The manager last night said that it takes about 2 weeks to make their kimchi in-house. The soup is authentic and it&#39;s worth a try. It&#39;s a little salty, so make sure you get a side of rice for it.I&#39;m definitely coming back.

The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar). The blackberry fig one was like an extremely tough, dense piece of bread with an admittedly tasty glaze (could definitely taste the fig!). Even split between two people we only managed a few bites.

It was everything I anticipated, and then some.The Cinnamon Snail is located inside of the Pennsy, which offers a collection of order-at-counter shops. Everything from meats, seafood, a bar, etc. Cinnamon Snail is the only full-vegan shop inside of the Pennsy. You order and then sit inside the shared space within the Pennsy, almost like a high-end cafeteria. As a vegan dating a non-vegan, we really valued this set up since we each got to get the food we preferred, but still sit and eat together. The interior was aesthetically pleasing, lit up with beautiful natural lighting.The servers at the counter of the cinnamon snail were very friendly and welcoming. They were attentive to my questions and answered appropriately.I ordered the beast mode burger and the raspberry cheesecake donut. The food menu is minimal, so I had a somewhat easy time choosing the burger. But the sweets selection is so extensive that I had a difficult time just choosing one item. I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for. The pretzel bun took everything to another level.Prices were on the higher end ($11.02 burger, $3.50 donut) but I suppose I can justify it with 1) The burger was soo filling and 2) artisanal donut.

The frosting on top solidified, but the donut itself was still really soft. I really liked the Raspberry and Chocolate combo - they go really well together. The Maple Smoked Almond was flaky and had a different texture than the Raspberry Blackout. It was more thick, dry, and relatively small in size compared to the other two. The Lemon donut was pretty good. It was more like the Raspberry Blackout in texture.

I liked it because it wasn&#39;t pretending to be near, but was still satisfying to eat, with the sort of cinnamony sweetness that was subtle enough to be enjoyable. The jalapeo mac and cheese on top made for a really weird mouthfeel and great taste. Too subtle on the bacon replacement, didn&#39;t really notice it, but it did no harm. The pretzel bun was tasty but dry. Vegan baked goods looked good so we grabbed the &#34;chocolate peanut butter cookie doughnut&#34; because those are the most beautiful words in the English language - dry and heavy but the ganache was good, wouldve liked less cake to the doughnut because it wasn&#39;t too dry with the center ganache on it.We grabbed a cider from the bar while we waited outside on a nice LDW Saturday.

The chocolate glaze on the donut was crumbly and the almonds on the marble almond bacon bacon tasted burnt.The reason it didn&#39;t receive a 5 star for me is because 1) even though there was only one person behind me, I felt very rushed when I was ordering and 2) all the donuts were different sizes.

Only giving it two stars because the employees are very nice. Did not enjoy the taste of the products or the pricing of them .I&#39;ll start with some positives:1. The workers are kind and very genuine2. There is free wifi3. There are a lot of seats and tables here, and with the wifi, you can potentially do some work here if you wanted to.On the flip side,1. The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called). It literally tasted like protein and it was VERY starchy. No sweetness and felt as though it wasn&#39;t complete. For $10, I expected a lot more.2. My friend ordered a coffee smoothie and had a similar problem with mine. I tried his, and also thought it tasted terrible.3. I ordered the ginger cayenne lemon shots as well. I was so excited because a lot of restaurant don&#39;t add the cayenne. What seemed like a lot of potential, ended up being a shot that might have been better with only ginger. The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4. It took a little over 20 minutes to get my order, which for a pretty empty juice place, seemed kind of long.Overall, not a fan of the smoothies, the ginger shot, or the price.

Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this.

Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

Highly recommended for a quick sandwich on the go whether you&#39;re jumping on the train or a bus. There are three small stools along the wall if you decide to eat inside. Go for the Cassoni - a delightful cheesy pocket sandwich with a wide array of meat options.The menu is split between Piadine (open sandwich), Cassoni (pocket sandwich), and Piadizze (small pizzas). We tried the Siciliano Cassoni and the Diavola Piadine. Both were very good, though I enjoyed the cheesy pocket of the cassoni more given the greasiness of Diavola. The Siciliano was a combination of eggplant, ham and cheese melted together and enclosed in a flaky crust to make a perfect sandwich.

We were surprised by how small it was! there&#39;s virtually no seating space, so be prepared to either eat your food elsewhere. That being said, the inside of the place is very cute!Our cashier was amazingly friendly. She found out that it was our first time eating here, and quickly explained the different types of foods they prepare. I ended up ordering the Piemontese Cassone, and my boyfriend got the Newyorkese Piada. They came out pretty quickly, and they were piping hot! I actually had to wait about 10 minutes until mine was cool enough, but I&#39;m kind of wimpy when it comes to temperature.The Newyorkese Piada was really yummy! All the ingredients tasted really fresh, and the consistency of the bread was nice.Now, I take my truffles seriously, and the Piemontese Cassone really knocked my socks off. When I opened the lid of the takeout container, the hypnotic aroma of truffle oil washed over me, and I knew that I was really going to enjoy this. I fought through my fear of burning my tongue so I could devour this cassone, which is a testament to how good it smelled. It was totally worth it. You really can&#39;t go wrong with truffle oil, mozzarella, and sausage. There are so many other interesting things on the menu, but I&#39;m so in love with this cassone that I wouldn&#39;t mind only getting this when I come back to Non Solo Piada.One thing to note is that the portions aren&#39;t big!

This place makes everything on a type of flat breadAfter staring at the menu, I ordered the Margherita which is Roman plum tomatoes, mozzarella, pomodoro sauce, and basil in &#34;pizza&#34; form. So when you are a lover of New York and New Haven style pizzas, and you order what looks like it should be a pizza, then getting served &#34;pizza&#34; on a flatbread is a little disappointing. Had this been explained before I placed the order, I probably would have gotten a different flavor. The woman tells us what it is well after the order is placed and she heard my friend saying that she didn&#39;t want to eat anything from there since she didn&#39;t know what any of it was.The flatbread was made to order, and it had a nice fresh flavor. It&#39;s something that I would get again if I were on a diet and didn&#39;t want the guilt of eating regular pizza.The Americano was like a flat bread sandwich. It had grilled chicken, mozzarella, and roasted peppers. All I could taste was the cheese. The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said &#34;i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?&#34; So I deconstructed a piece of the second half. There was a small amount of chicken, but it looked shredded, just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn&#39;t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich.This place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner.

First trip to the big apple and my girlfriend and I were looking for a quick lunch before we go on a trip to the financial district. The pictures on yelp instantly got me, so we decided to check it out. I got a pizza with baby arugula and prosciutto...from the first bite I knew I found a new home in New York. The crust was paper thin and the sauce was marvelous..so good we had to come twice in a span of 3 days. My girlfriend had a calzone with pancetta chicken and of course mozzarella. It had a little secret ingredient added in there as well some Oregano just to give it that perfect taste for taste buds to go insane. The service was amazing as well the girl at the cashier was very nice and attentive. For a small place in the city I got exactly what I was looking for, a little whole in the wall with lots of love and flavor.

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own.

Some other well known pizza places only allow you to commit to a whole pie, so we loved the option here. You have about 24+ kinds of pizza to choose from by the slice. It&#39;s amazing to be able to try all kinds of variations. I opted for a slice of mushroom, and my husband had a slice of the grandma&#39;s and the suprema.

I&#39;ve also come to the realization that I was much too harsh in my initial review.The first thing about this place is that you need to know what to order. The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema. Come by the next time you have something to do in Penn, or MSG.The last time I came here, there seemed to be a card minimum, but I think it has since been dropped?

It is a full service, sit down location, in addition to take out. Beyond Sushi&#39;s 100% vegan menu has really expanded since they first started, and it&#39;s all amazing! The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited (off peak hours), but it definitely was speedy and attentive service here. The decor was beautiful- clean, simple and spacious. Plenty of seating.The food here is always fresh and made to order. Special attention is given to presentation and plating, making the food look even more appetizing. Sushi rolls here are colorful and unique! Don&#39;t expect your average avocado roll. You would not be able to find plant-based rolls like Beyond Sushi anywhere else.For this visit, I tried the seasonal roll, with Korean sweet potato filling. Really yummy! As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before. They are not trying to imitate meat/ fish, but trying to highlight PLANT foods. Prices are reasonable, especially for vegan food. There are lunchtime combos (e.g. sushi roll + dumpling, or sushi roll + salad).

You could fit a Uniqlo inside here. It&#39;s absolutely massive. A huge step for the team, and soon, this latest restaurant will begin to serve beer, sake, and sake cocktails as well. But that&#39;s still a ways out as they continue to push papers with local government officials. For now, come simply to enjoy art in vegetable-based sushi form.I&#39;ve had many of their rolls over the years, but it was suggested I give their steamed dumplings a try. It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m easily persuaded, because The Badge was a delightful appetizer. The dumpling features charred cabbage, onion, garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and sesame oil topped with chili panko, cilantro, and ponzu sauce. The panko gives it some texture, and honestly, you don&#39;t miss the usual pork or crab filling in the center. It&#39;s its own thing, and it&#39;s delicious.If you can&#39;t decide on what roll you&#39;d like, opt for the four-piece sampler where you&#39;ll get to try a smattering of the following rolls:Charred corn with harrisa and cilantroCurried cauliflower with almond pestoRoasted tomato with tomato guajilloSeaweed salad with chili flakes and sesame seedsIt circles the wagons on taste profile and uniqueness, and it&#39;s a good way to try many different flavors without breaking the bank (or elasticity in your stomach). The roasted tomato roll might be my least favorite of the grouping, but you&#39;ll hardly notice since everything else is so satisfying.For the first time, you can actually bring a huge group to a Beyond Sushi. 70% of their clientele isn&#39;t vegan, but rather fans of delicious food.

The panini had a satisfying crunch to it, and overall sandwich was fantastic.To get to the full groupon amount ($20), I also got a whole wheat croissant with jelly (awesome and almost guilt-free!) and a pistachio-creme croissant (wonderful). To be honest, I actually left without the pistachio croissant and noticed the missing item when I got back to my place in LIC.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences.

To top it all off, the aioli was super tasty and all the flavors combined for a nice bite.With each sandwich you get a bag of chips--which I didn&#39;t even need since the sandwich was so filling--and it only came out to around $10, so not a bad deal for lunch in HK.If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, definitely check this place out.

What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking.

The base could be white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, or japchae. Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got.

There was also a VERY loud banging noise upstairs, which is obviously not the restaurant&#39;s fault, but that didn&#39;t add to the ambiance, and was distracting enough that I thought I&#39;d mention it.Underwhelming, but I wouldn&#39;t totally discount it, maybe other dishes are more exciting.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "115", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "102", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "38", "Review_length": 219}, {"Review ": "My new favorite lunch place near Penn Station.

The baristas have found a way to brew coffee such that it does its job (wake you up) without leaving you with the usual aftertaste one gets from mediocre brews.The cozy patina may at first seem cramped or small, but how much better it is than a dozen desks full of people working or in meetings. The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication. And of course, they make awesome coffee.--Overall, ALT is an genuine coffee shop. It does not concern itself with being a coworking space that serves coffee or a faux-vintage caffeine dispenser.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar). The blackberry fig one was like an extremely tough, dense piece of bread with an admittedly tasty glaze (could definitely taste the fig!). Even split between two people we only managed a few bites.

I was sad to find this out after I arrived, but fortunately the Cinnamon Snail had their truck set up outside.Decided to get the Tofu Burger (with gluten free bread) and a Peanut Butter Blondie. The total came to about $18 which was partially expected. I was excited to try the burger since it seemed quite good, but was overall very disappointed. The tofu was extremely bland (not sure if it was even marinated) despite being extremely saucy. My sandwich was dripping sauce, but it tasted not much more than a block of tofu with some light creamy/oily sauce that lacked salt. The sandwich fell far below my expectations so I moved onto my dessert. Upon taking it out of the bag, it started crumbling to pieces (which makes somewhat sense because it&#39;s gluten free). It was very little for what&#39;s it&#39;s worth. I liked the fact that it wasn&#39;t overly sweet, but it was pretty average in taste.Overall, my experience would&#39;ve been a 1 star review.

There were not enough tables/chairs for 90% of the people there. I ordered four bagels with plain cream cheese and the total came out to $17. What!?! Why? Because they charge 1.35 for bagels, but for cream cheese, you have to purchase that separately... Depending on the cream cheese, it ranges from $2-$5? Which is crazy! After seeing the total I was like what the heck!? I had high expectations for it. Our order came super fast, because the staff worked really fast.Because of the very limited seating, my family and I had no other options than to go to McDonald&#39;s for seating #sad.Upon arrival at McDonald&#39;s and finding a table really quickly, we took our first bite. We first noticed that the bagel is SUPER doughy, and not in a good way. It tasted undercooked, and I had no idea why people were giving this place 5 stars?!For how pricey these bagels were, I expected it to be better.

The layout of the store is a little confusing, as it&#39;s not super clear where you line up to ORDER the bagel, and then where you go to pay for the bagel/order any additional drinks. Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema.

It is definitely pretty congested during the day time as it is a hotspot for tourists.As it approaches sunset/evening, the place gets less packed and it becomes a better spot for something very low key, tranquil. This unintentionally became the spot I always ended up at when it came to having deep conversations/catching up with a friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while, or mending a relationship that was once broken. It is also a perfect spot for a nice walk after a cute date.The Highline is decorated with a variety of flowers, greenery, a tiny water way. It is surrounded with expensive apartment complexes that you can only dream of one day living in. You get a beautiful view of the city when the sun begins to set.

Inspired by the three-mile Promenade plante that opened in Paris a decade earlier, the 1.5-mile High Line was the classic case of a committed nonprofit with wealthy backers arm wrestling with a labyrinth of city bureaucracy intent on demolishing an eighty-year-old elevated railroad track.You can see remnants of those old tracks and trestles throughout the trail, but it&#39;s really the intimate and panoramic views of Lower Manhattan, the variety of foliage and unique art pieces (&#34;Mutations&#34; is the latest exhibition), and the abundance of wooden seating areas, in particular, those chaise lounges, that make the High Line such an inviting experience no matter how crowded. The irony was that on our most recent visit, the High Line felt more like a ghost trail as the stormy weather scared people off except the most persistent of tourists (photo:bit.ly/2t8jJo1).

Granted, if you enter from the same place that I did, there isn&#39;t much to see until you get about a quarter of the way through. That is where the grass is greener (literally) and you&#39;ll begin to see much nicer decor.

In light of it&#39;s name, you&#39;re likely to develop a neck cramp from all of the things there are to see. There is LITERALLY a view of something breathtaking from EVERY angle and 2 out of our 3 party crew ran out of mobile memory.^ Got a thing for futuristic if not downright, urbanesque landscapes amid lush foliage? --- You betcha&#39; patoot&#39;, you&#39;ll locate it here! This impeccably constructed paradise manages to evoke the glass high-rise splendor that is Vancouver, with flare, pizzazz and charm that only New York can somehow convey.#does-anybody-hear-me?^ Tired of HGTV&#39;s &#34;House Hunters&#34; episode repeats? --- I know. Me neither, lol, but trust me. Your high def- television channel surf stops here and is just as easily replaced by reality itself, with the upscale (albeit COMPLETELY overpriced) condo&#39;s that line this entire facade&#39;. The Standard - High Line is just as worthy of delving into when making way out, so don&#39;t forget to Bookmark it as well.^ Got an inner Picasso? --- Well, the art work and inspiring sculptures create a vibe that&#39;s unparalleled. Upon departing you&#39;ll be ready to paint your own Mona Lisa. (I, personally, settled for some colored pencils and my nephew&#39;s Pokemon coloring book and I&#39;ve copy-written my masterpiece, so don&#39;t go gettin&#39; any ideas).________And to further it all, there are a plethora of just as picturesque turn-outs to better take photos that will likely last a lifetime.^ What they don&#39;t tell you:Restrooms within this attraction are scarce (I/we counted 2 within the 2 mile trek). &#34;HOLD ON!!!&#34; (another En Vogue reference) --- not to your love.

(sighs), not so much.&#34;Whyyy, oh whyyy must it be thissa&#39; way?!!&#34;Sure we&#39;ve got &#34;Runyon Canyon&#34; that within itself boasts some darned impressive panoramic vistas, but outside of &#34;The Strand&#34; - connecting Hermosa Beach (traveling a good 20 miles north) to Santa Monica, I can&#39;t state there to be any such comparable within LA and need I say there&#39;s just something distinct about New York&#39;s &#34;High Line&#34; that ups the ante all the more, presenting it with its very own intensified caliber of flare.Upon surviving the lavender scented feat (one way managed to exhaust us), w/o obstruction do I now know why New Yorkers always seem to tote a pair of comfy &#39;kicks on their person.

It seems like most people visit to walk from end to end- 1.45 miles. However, the platform was originally designed just to be wide enough for a train, so it wasn&#39;t hard to get stuck behind slower people on some parts of the line, stopping everyone behind them.

Because of the wide selection, it can be very overwhelming. When you get closer to the counter there is a display with the flavors they offer.

The second you bite into this donut you are in heaven... because you will be left wondering how they concentrated the flavors so well. I was really looking forward to the matcha green donut but was disappointed that the matcha taste did not come through that much. It was not executed well and I am not sure why, seeing as how the donut was very green. The glaze was a regular glaze, the donut was green. Was this a mixture of food coloring and matcha? Who knows. I&#39;m always down for green tea; this donut did not pass the test. Yes it was a good donut in other regards: size, density, level of greasiness and sweetness... but it was missing something for this matcha lover.There is an app you can download and pay with.

There was subtle strawberry taste, and a strong sugary taste from the cream. The dough texture was thin, and seemed to be barely keeping the doughnut together. This was about 2x the size of a munchkin from Dunkin&#39; Donuts.Verdict:Way, way, WAYYY too sweet, not for me, but in general.

Not too sweet, not too tangy filling. Perfectly balanced. I do wish there was more jam, because at times I bit into the donut and only got dough. However, I know if they put too much, the ratio would be off. I just love that damn jam!Hazelnut -- My least favorite. The filling was hazelnut but had a sweet, jam like aftertaste.

I typically do not wait in line for brunch, and prefer to go to restaurants that offer reservations. BUT my friend was raving about the fried chicken and waffle so I was sufficiently intrigued.The best thing about this fried chicken and waffle is how perfectly crisp the crust is on that juicy chicken. Mind you, it&#39;s not marinated at all, and the only flavor contrast you get is the honey tobacco, but that fry was soooo dang good that I didn&#39;t quite miss the marinade (I&#39;m speaking of Korean fried chicken here). The waffle was also golden brown and magically maintained its crispness throughout the entire meal, despite my generous pour of the honey tobasco.The chicken did have a lot of bone in it, which was inevitable I guess given that leg meat is the most delicious... however, I do prefer a boneless fried chicken especially with breakfast and I am not that keen on heavy utensil use!As good as that chicken and waffle was, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth $24. If I came back, I would split it with a friend and then order another brunch item.Oooooh, and you must try the cornbread!

There&#39;s nothing that lights up his face more than cutting into a bloody slab (absolutely nothing, including me).So for his birthday this year, I picked Keen&#39;s.

They give you free bread and crudite/dip: the bread, while not the best house bread, was at least toasted. My boyfriend got the prime rib, I got the lobster salad, and we ordered the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes to share.Now, let me be clear. That prime rib was heavenly. Even better than my lobster salad. It needed no salt or steak sauce. (While I&#39;m on the topic of salt, Keen&#39;s includes a blurb on the menu that says you can ask them to tweak the salt level but only for certain dishes.) It came with a garlic and horseradish sauce but I preferred the meat without. The bliss on my boyfriend&#39;s face was over 9,000 at this point.Holy crap, the sides. I was a bit skeptical about the creamed spinach but that was the one I ended up liking the most. Mashed potatoes were fine. Sauted mushrooms came out a little too oily but I ate embarrassing portions of it nonetheless.Even though we were hurting at this point, we ordered the butterscotch sundae.

I&#39;ve been to Peter Luger before, and I loved their bacon but I wasn&#39;t too keen on travelling to Brooklyn. Keens, on the other hand, was walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to make it easy on us.As soon as I stepped inside, I liked the vibe and the atmosphere. It has that classy steakhouse feel, a bit dark and vintage-like, if you know what I mean. We were seated promptly, and attended to right away with menus for food and drinks.The wine list was pretty affordable, which I appreciated, and the food menu was self-explanatory. We weren&#39;t too hungry after eating all day long, so we decided to pass on the appetizer/salad, and just order the porterhouse for two and two sides.When we got our steak, it was cooked perfectly, and the meat was delicious. The mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms were also winners. We thought we weren&#39;t hungry, but we finished everything, that is how good it was.I can&#39;t say it was the best steak I had, but it was certainly one of the best steakhouses I&#39;ve been to overall. Service, ambience, history, and the food all rank pretty high for me. Also it was our last night in NY, so it was a perfect ending to a fantastic trip.We would definitely come back, and I hope to try their bacon so I can compare it to Peter Luger&#39;s. I can&#39;t say which is a better steakhouse for me, but both are definitely worth your time. Excellent service always helps, and the service from the manager to our waitress was great.

Some are newer and come with all the modern service and decor you would expect to have for a high end establishment. Some are old and though they come with a lot of history they fall short of the carry through to the modern day with the quality that keeps up with surrounding options.Keens, amazingly, seems to fit into a sweat spot somewhere in between. As you enter the old world maze that the building is with the pipes above your head everywhere you are also met with a service and food quality that easily beats some of the newer places.I had a Caesar salad with the legendary mutton chop. Though the chop was a little more work than I expected (but I guess that is what all lamb chops mostly are with this just at a larger scale) it still was a wonderful experience and don&#39;t let the &#39;mutton&#39; term turn you off as it was as tender, or even more so, than lamb I have had anywhere else and I found it not to have a stronger taste either.And, about those pipes...(from their website) Keens owns the largest collection of churchwarden pipes in the world. The tradition of checking one&#39;s pipe at the inn had its origins in 17th century Merrie Old England where travelers kept their clay at their favorite inn - the thin stemmed pipe being too fragile to be carried in purse or saddlebag. Pipe smoking was known since Elizabethan times to be beneficial for dissipating &#34;evil homourse of the brain.&#34; Keens&#39;s pipe tradition began in the early 20th century.The hard clay churchwarden pipes were brought from the Netherlands and as many as 50,000 were ordered every three years. A pipe warden registered and stored the pipes, while pipe boys returned the pipes from storage to the patrons.The membership roster of the Pipe Club contained over ninety thousand names, including those of Teddy Roosevelt, Babe Ruth, Will Rogers, Billy Rose, Grace Moore, Albert Einstein, George M. Cohan, J.P. Morgan, Stanford White, John Barrymore, David Belasco, Adlai Stevenson, General Douglas MacArthur and &#34;Buffalo Bill&#34; Cody.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "1116", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "4", "Friendcount": "150", "funnyvote": "5", "No_of_checkin": "2", "No_of_Photos": "289", "Review_length": 357}, {"Review ": "I never truly understood when people describe food as &#34;melting&#34; in their mouth until I put the Chateaubriand from Keens in my mouth.

Keens, having satisfied the beef (and mutton chop!) jones of locals since 1885 is one of those places. I dined here on July 3rd.In walking distance from Penn Station, Keens is a dark panelled cozy joint with(literally) an abundant amount of smoking pipes wedged in the wall. I&#39;ll leave it to a historian to explain that but it is a cool touch.Upon arrival, four of my amazing friends were seated and saying &#34;what took you so long?&#34;. I replied &#34;LIRR&#34;. We all know what that means.Nothing can stop a good man with an OCD plan, so I settled myself with what......a .Grey Goose Vodka Martini. The drink was pricy but wonderfully stiff, a fact much appreciated since we all were heading to Japas 38 to sing karaoke that evening. Nothing like a little lubricant to hit those notes.The meal started with a real bummer. The Bacon App was overcooked and oversalted, nothing like the splendid version I had at Luger LI several months ago.However, Keens rocked when the entrees came. My 28 ounce Prime Rib was a beautifully cooked medium rare, tending more toward rare. It was luscious and tender with a concentrated and rich beefy taste. I liked it better than the one I had at Lugers. It was hard, but I finished it. I ordered buttery, creamy and savory Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes as a side. Yummo!!!My fellow diners gave gushing praise to their steaks: T-Bone and Filet Mignon. Two diners shared a delicious Lobster Bisque. I did not have dessert but I heard praise for the Affogato and Carrot Cake.BOTTOM LINE: If you like Peter Luger, you&#39;ll like Keens.

Service was fine, the menu was what you could expect at most steakhouses in the city, and prices were on par. The problem was the flavor/execution/style. The consistent theme for us was the lack of seasoning (salt).I&#39;ll focus my review on the three key items we had: the mutton chop, the t-bone, and the side of mushrooms. The mutton chop we had was done near medium-well to well done, an error that is quite bizarre for a steakhouse of Keens&#39; stature, but I guess that could happen... Our server agreed and we quickly got a revised medium-rare chop. The problem is, I just didn&#39;t care for the revised version: the chop is rather large with half of what you see in the pictures a layer of fat and the meat close to the middle of the bone was surprisingly not as tender as I expected. The chop was hard to eat and when you could get a handle on it, the flavor was a bit bland (mild in mutton flavor) and lacked taste when it boils down to it. The t-bone was cooked perfectly medium rare but it was also the most under-seasoned steak I&#39;ve had in New York. Perhaps this is their style, or they messed up, but whatever it was it just wasn&#39;t my thing. The mushrooms also was not up to the steakhouse standard I&#39;ve come to expect- large portioned, uber buttery and silky. What we got was something I would cook.I&#39;ve been to 5 or 6 of the &#34;iconic&#34; New York steakhouses, and to me the food at Keens&#39; was the most &#34;off&#34; relative to the others.

If you have to choose between here and Peter Luger&#39;s choose Keen&#39;s. One of the best restaurants anywhere and one of the most unique dining experiences you can have. A true food experience.Reservations are usually needed and sometimes well in advance. If you have to sit at the bar, you&#39;re in luck. You can eat at the bar, and Todd is one of the best and most personable bartender&#39;s in the city. He made the best old fashioned I have ever ordered. They have one of the largest selections of Scotch and Whisky anywhere. Always a great conversation to be had at this bar. Worth a visit just for a drink.Of course I had to get the mutton chop which is really technically a young saddle of lamb and not Mutton. It is the best piece of lamb I have ever had. I believe it was a 32 oz portion. I finished the whole thing in one sitting along with the side of thick cut bacon which is a must. The mint jelly that came with the mutton chop was also the best I ever had with a piece of lamb. You could have loaded it up with vodka and made a drink out of it and I would gladly try that drink. The sauteed escarole is one of my favorite sides at any steakhouse.The steaks here are top notch and many like them better than Peter Luger&#39;s. These are the truest prime grade dry ages steak you can get. Keen&#39;s ages them in house I believe for as many as 28 days. The T-bone I ordered was the best cut of that steak I ever had. I would give the fillet side of the porter house at Luger&#39;s the edge but they are very close. There are many great appetizers on the menu and the oyster&#39;s were very large as well as Fresh.This place is a museum unlike any restaurant I have been in. Very old School and classic with wood paneling everywhere. Dark, cozy, charming and romantic. The ceilings are covered in clay pipes signed by different celebrities. You feel like you are in a very old mansion. The most famous are out front in a glass case and include Babe Ruth and Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s pipe. The staff loves to point out the history to you and showed me where they keep the playbill from the night Lincoln was assassinated. This restaurant is worth going to just for the feel and history located within it alone.On return visits I have ordered The King&#39;s Cut Prime Rib at $61, which is the biggest, juiciest, most tender piece of Prime Rib I have ever had. It is a huge shareable cut, Flintstone sized, so come hungry and don&#39;t expect to have much room left for anything else when you order this. Once you&#39;ve tried their mutton chop, this is the next must try dish on the menu.The burger is not as good as Peter Luger&#39;s, but it is a great burger and has that unique nutty burst of beef flavor that is unmistakably a burger made from dry aged steak trimmings. It was cooked to a perfect medium and I would take this burger any day over much more hyped burger&#39;s in the city such as J.G Melon&#39;s and The Minetta Tavern. With fries for under $20 its a pretty good deal.

I just had a root canal so he suggested the shrimp and the the Dover sole. It took about 20 minutes for our food to come out. The sole was amazing - lightly salted with a lemon butter....what more could you ask for. I had the shrimp and spinach. The shrimp wa good but the spinach tasted as if it want washed before cooking. It left a filmy residue in my mouth. To be honest I preferred the sole to my shrimp. I would&#39;ve preferred a steak but I couldn&#39;t bite into it. But the ones I did see looked so succulent and perfectly prepared. It was soo good I saw strangers sitting next to each other bond over how good the steak actually was.We also ordered dessert - key lime pie.

The fact that it is oldest (or second oldest) steakhouse in the city was only a small factor- the reviews written by my fellow Yelpers was what sealed the deal. That, and its close proximity to the hotel I&#39;d booked (Kimpton Eventi - another stroke in the Winning column). They accept reservations a month in advance as well- one less thing I had to worry about as I planned our anniversary weekend.Anyone perusing my reviews will come to the obvious conclusion that this guy loves his beef! Its true, I really do- and my wife is of similar mind (though we differ on favorite cuts, but that&#39;s another story) so I was a bit apprehensive yet excited! We strolled the six short blocks to the restaurant, enjoying the unique vibe that is NYC on a Friday evening and entered a rather unassuming storefront - which transformed to this elegant, dark wood and brass accented foyer that led into a spacious and attractive dining area. We were seated at a booth just next to the order window and not far from the entrance so we could people watch. It is a really nice restaurant with a lot of history- there are old playbills and daguerreotypes of distinguished actors, patrons and visitors and a fulsome collection of clay pipes suspended from the ceiling, some 90,000 and based on an old English custom of hanging one&#39;s pipe at one&#39;s favorite establishment.Our waiter was named Andres, and was the example of classy and reserved waitstaff one would expect of a high class spot like Keens, and like the restaurant, he did not disappoint. Never intrusive, his timing was impeccable and showed a willingness to see our dining experience be one of our best, I tip my hat to him, he was a consummate pro. Drinks ordered appeared quickly but unobtrusively, and whenever they got low, we&#39;d see Andres again with an inquiring look. You have to appreciate that sort of service. Now, on to the really good part...the food!I must apologize for not having any pictures to back up what I&#39;m writing- we were pretty hungry after a longish road trip and experiencing that level of traffic for the first time in years, so when the food arrived we set to with a will. We both ordered the filet, which came perfectly seared and cooked to order, along with fries (not my usual choice but they are recommended, and rightly so) and sauteed vegetables. It wasn&#39;t until recently that I bothered to learn more about the different grades of beef and what those classifications mean (basically, the more marble or fat content within a specific cut- the more the merrier, basically) and there is a difference. This restaurant serves choice or better and it shows- the flavor and tenderness of the filet was as close to perfection as you can get it, sublime truly. Was it the best steak I ever had? No. Stoney River still holds that distinction, but this was a very close second to be sure. Moving on, the fries were perfect, but I expected that and the vegetables were cooked but retained their crisp and had a delicate flavor that didn&#39;t get in the way of the rest of the meal. Naturally, we left no room for dessert but it was just as well- we&#39;d just eaten like royalty. Andres brought us a couple of flutes of champagne on the house in honor of our anniversary- I tell you, that guy&#39;s a prince!All in all, we had a lovely time, this place deserves the five stars- so much so, we&#39;ll be back, and if my wife has any say, relatively soon!

The interior design is similar to your &#34;steakhouse&#34; and very dim inside. I wish the place had a higher ceiling, but this is not a determining factor. I suggest visiting this place during lunch because during dinner, it&#39;s insane.The waiters are superb and on-point. They are professional and understand the restaurant&#39;s food very well. Yes, when you&#39;re there, you are there for the steak. I had the opportunity to try the dry-aged t-bone steak, which had 3 different types of meat on it. For decoration purposes, the restaurant leans the t-bone side ways to give the &#34;tower&#34; look.The meat... remember how Homer Simpsons just drools thinking about beer or food? This is basically what you will experience. You will drool at the smell, the sight, and the taste. Not only is it juicy, bursting with flavor, and tender, but the seasoning is on-point. To be more specific, some steakhouses are great, but some chefs have heavy hands with salt. However, Keens did it just right, and the steak did not push me to drink more water. The fat on the steak was proportionate and complimented the &#34;meat&#34; very well. Yes, it melts in your mouth, so don&#39;t cut out everything that is not &#34;meat.&#34; The temperature on the steak is on-point and warms your tongue when you take a bite of it.Portion is huge, and I know we all want to be full at the end. You will be full. With the sides, you don&#39;t have to go too crazy with the sides and ordering one or two is perfect for 2 people. I always recommend veggie sides because it balances the meat.Seriously, I can&#39;t say enough about this place and how all their steaks are perfect. Try to get the 2 people portion porterhouse or dry-aged steaks because those are definitely better than the one people portion steaks.Overall, this is my choice for a steak in the U.S.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "78", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "4", "Friendcount": "111", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 329}, {"Review ": "This was my third time at Keens.

A steak house standard right?! All great, except the red wine just. Very simply was just nothing that special about it. My colleagues had ordered the Chateaubriand which came with three sauces so i swapped my red wine sauce for the mushroom sauce which complimented the dish much better in my opinion.Tip: if there are two of you who are going to order the filet mignon each, go for the Chateaubriand instead. You get much more meat and it was a little more on the tasty side - not to say that the filet mignon wasn&#39;t good though, don&#39;t get me wrong!Naturally, despite being full i still reached for the dessert menu. My colleague and i shared the coffee cantata and the Lady M chocolate cake. Any cake fan in NYC should know that Lady M do great cakes so that was a given but the coffee cantata was really enjoyable.

This review will explain how I came to give them 3 stars.Usually when I plan a trip to NYC, I do it well in advance and research places to eat. This time, we had to make the trip on short notice as we had a death in the extended family. So...I didn&#39;t get to do thorough research.We were here at Keen&#39;s on a rainy Friday night for an early dinner, arriving just before 5 p.m. At that time, the dining room wasn&#39;t very busy, thus easy to be seated as a walk-in. The bar area, however, was busy and loud. Keen&#39;s is like many Manhattan restaurants---meaning they pack in the tables. We had about 6 inches between our two-top and the one next to us.At first, our waiter was friendly and efficient. He took our drink orders. My husband had a Bloody Mary, while I had a whiskey sour. He thought his Bloody Mary was on the weak side. I took a sip---it was weak but yet the heat was there. The garnish was stingy---just a lime slice. My whiskey sour was decent. It was nice to see the garnish---a fresh black cherry.Our waiter was along to take the rest of our order. My husband got a shrimp cocktail and I got lobster bisque. The shrimp were large. While my husband ate it all, he pronounced it to be &#34;average&#34;. My lobster bisque looked like a traditional one but...it didn&#39;t even have a hint of sherry. All in all, it was decent with shredded lobster in it, but bland.For our main course, we each ordered an 8 oz. filet with one side of asparagus. Here is why I couldn&#39;t go higher in the rating. We sat and watched as the table next to us, who ordered after us, got their porterhouse steak. Then watched some more as tables that were seated after us got their food. Meanwhile, the waiter seemed to have disappeared.Since it was easier for my husband to get up (I was sitting at the long banquette and getting out would have been a big production), I told him to go to the host stand and ask for the manager. He talked to the manager who said he would send someone to talk to us. Another manager came to our table. She was very apologetic and said that there was a breakdown somewhere and would get to the bottom of it. I asked if we would be compensated for this. She said our drinks were on the house. Long story short, our entrees came out quickly at that point and she said that dessert would also be on the house.The steaks were excellent---cooked to a perfect medium rare and very tender. The asparagus portion was stingy---6 spears but properly cooked and the accompanying hollandaise sauce was well prepared.Meanwhile, we still didn&#39;t see our waiter, as food runners brought the food to us. Finally, the waiter showed up to take our dessert orders. Never once did he apologize. We both chose creme brulee and it was tasty, with the portion size being just right.True to the manager&#39;s word, the drinks and dessert were free. Again, she apologized and said she hoped that we would come back again. We didn&#39;t give the waiter 20%, rather, we gave 15%. Also, we explained to the manager that we tend to give 20% but couldn&#39;t justify it in this case. She agreed with us and said that the waiter heard from her about this debacle.When we go to an upscale restaurant, the expectation is that service should be impeccable. That was far from the case here. I doubt that we would return again when in NYC.

Super thick cut, juicy and very savory and fatty (in a good way). The first time it came out, it was a bit too rare for us and we requested it to be cooked a bit more.

The downtown Eataly is a little more organized. We went to the pasta/pizza restaurant in the back. The wait was only about 10 minutes, but there were no tables opened; it was completely full.We ordered the tagliatelle and the lasagna dish with some chardonnay. The chardonnay was fresh, which was very nice.

The pasta was thin but full of flavor. The sauce and the beef was unparalleled. The lasagna was as expected. One of the best lasagna&#39;s I&#39;ve had in NYC - aside from La Lanterna di Vittorio. All of the cheeses came through and the pasta was delicious.We finished off with gelato. Honestly, not the best gelato - it&#39;s a little over sweetened and their whipped cream is store bought, as opposed to Grom. If you want quality gelato, go to Grom.Eataly is definitely touristy and it&#39;s very concentrated with people. However, there&#39;s a reason for its popularity.

What I hate the most is, I ran into a so-called pop-up sale a few weeks ago and most of the cookies were BOGO. It was literally the first few hours of the sale, so the manager was there piping up cookie bags to the shelf. I overheard his conversation with a customer who seems to be a tourist and he had many bags of cookies in his basket. The customer said:&#34;We just came at the right time.&#34; The manager responded something like:&#34;Yeah, they are really good deal. Usually these are more expensive.&#34;I thought so, too, at first, and had 4 bags in my arms already. But when I checked the expiration date (my habit), I was surprised to see that all of them were a few weeks away from expiring. This is the real reason why they are on sale. Not some pop-up sale or a good deal happening at all. Of course, this is all about marketing strategy. But at least you should be responsible and don&#39;t make it as you are doing customers a huge favor. Chains like CVS or Duane Reade have sales all the time, including items that are expiring soon. However, they won&#39;t advertise or fantasize it as customer appreciation sale.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! It is REALLY HARD to memorize TWO TOPPINGS that have been repeated 4 TIMES I guess!!! And when I got my cannoli, there were only corn cookie crumbs. I asked the cannoli-maker if she put espresso on it, she was like:&#34; You want espresso too?&#34; WTH!!! You heard me say it when I told the cashier and you CHARGED ME for 2 toppings!!!!

It&#39;s almost like stepping into Italy for a bit. You basically step inside to the most amazing Italian marketplace where all your culinary dreams can come true. They have everything: sauces, vegetables, meats, cheese, fruits, imported goods, cafes, wine bars, gelato, pizza, fresh pasta, etc etc - I could go on forever. They even having glassware and cookware. I could go crazy shopping in here if I knew I couldn&#39;t bring it all back to Hawaii with me. I was in foodie heaven. These are the times I wish I still lived in NY!After buying some packaged goods to bring back and a few meats that I decided I could eat on the plane, we decided to stay for dinner at one the eateries within and chose La Pizza &amp; La Pasta. Everything was made fresh in house. We got to sit at bar style seating right near the pizza oven which was actually pretty cool. Bread &amp; water was brought and our wine &amp; beer orders taken. We started with the Crostino con Ricotta, Lavanda e Miele [$8] which translates to housemade ciabatta with Liuzzi Ricotta, Lavender by the bay, Honey and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. HOLY DELICIOUS! That ricotta was pure heaven. From the pizza menu we order the calzone [$18] which was fresh made and stuffed with mozzarella di bufala from napoli, ricotta &amp; prosciutto cotto &amp; topped with house made tomato sauce. Again, simple and delicious - real calzones are so much thinner than I ever realized. From the pasta menu we order the Tagliatelle al Rag di Manzo [$23] which features in house fresh made tagliatelle, short rib rag, Parmigiano Reggiano &amp; parsley. This dish was rich &amp; hearty, with big succulent chunks of meat and pasta that had just the right amount of chew, making it some of the best pasta I have ever eaten in my entire life. Between the wine and the food, I felt transported back to my own visit to Italy and found myself wanting to stay all night.

As a foodie and home cook, I imagine that my walking in here felt similar to those kids entering Willy Wonka&#39;s Chocolate Factory...minus the occasional bizarre/frightening moments.Honestly, I loved getting unintentionally lost in this maze of food and fantastic imported ingredients. Here are some highlights from the store section:-This would be on my list if I&#39;m planning a fancy picnic or home-cooked meal for people with more class than a school day!-Eataly boasts a solid selection of prepared foods (sandwiches, salads, hummus, etc.).-If you love cheese, then boom! Eataly has you covered with artisan cheeses from California to Vermont. Of course they also have plenty of Italian cheeses. Pair that with some cured meats from elsewhere in the store and you&#39;ll have a charcuterie plate you can be proud of.-Want something healthy? The produce section covers your basics (scallions, garlic, zucchini) but also offers some atypical items such as sea beans. I was particularly impressed by how gorgeous all the vegetables looked!-Speaking of vegetables, Eataly has a goddamn VEGETABLE BUTCHER on premises who will prepare vegetables to your specifications as you shop!-They make fresh pasta in-store that you can purchase to cook at home.-Meat and seafood department was also impressive! They dry age steaks and offer seafood from New England, Italy, and Africa!We didn&#39;t feel like cooking and were really excited to try the famed pizza but that turned into a bit of a fiasco. We wanted to take our pizza to go and asked for a to go menu. One woman up front said the menu hanging up was the to go menu. After a few minutes, we attempted to place our order, however, one of the appetizers was not available for to go orders. What the hell?! If it&#39;s not available for take out, then don&#39;t put it on the take out menu. We tried again with another item but still no dice. We figured one pizza was enough for the two of us.That woman was rude to us the entire time. I understand it was crowded and it was obvious she was overwhelmed with work, but damn you can&#39;t work in this business and have poor customer service.The pizza itself was lovely. We ordered the capricciosa which had tomato sauce, mozz di bufala, prosciutto cotto, mushrooms, artichokes, and olives. It&#39;s hard to complain with quality ingredients on a tasty crust. I loved that nice bit of char on the bottom, however, It was a bit soggy as I prefer that contrast of a light interior and crispy crust. Maybe it was just in the damn box for too long before we were able to nom.Either way, this is a fantastic place and worth a stop if you have the time!

The ingredients weren&#39;t the best, but Mew concealed this well with a combination of its hip ambience geared toward millennials and a trendy menu that included plenty of avocados.To better illustrate what I mean here, I will examine a few dishes that I ordered.The Tofu Avocado Salad:This was just some cubed soft tofu topped with sesame dressing, greens, and avocados. There was no source of flavor aside from the dressing, the greens were just leaves straight out of a bag (or so it seemed, because they were quite dry and not refreshing). For a dish with its name, there weren&#39;t enough greens nor avocados.However, the concept is trendy and good--tofu and avocado are appealing, especially when bonded together by the ever-popular sweet sesame dressing.Omusoba:This dish of yakisoba inside an omelette drizzled with mayo and sauce was an archetype of food popular among young people--hybrids, or &#39;takes&#39; on &#39;ethnic foods&#39; (as much as I dislike my use of the phrase &#39;ethnic foods,&#39; I am currently unable to conjure an adequate word for foods that tend to be categorized on the basis of the country or group they are from).The omelette was deliciously fluffy and was a good addition to the yakisoba, and the pork was good. But other than these and the idea being great, nothing was actually done extraordinarily well. The yakisoba tasted exactly the same from yakisoba made from a Maruchan kit, and the dish was something that could have easily been prepared at home. This (great idea, mediocre ingredients and preparation) was a recurring theme at Izakaya Mew.Closing RemarksWith their matcha-flavored cocktails, their 22:30 closing time, and their waiting staff&#39;s t-shirts printed with katakana, I couldn&#39;t help but wish that Mew had taken a bit more responsibility with the Japanese Izakaya title instead of just using its aesthetic.I had hoped to see a firmer commitment to the ingredients and dishes. But perhaps an extensive menu like Mew&#39;s inhibits that significantly. Overall, my belief is that an increase in quality in the ingredients and preparation of dishes will help Izakaya Mew become more deserving of the former half of its name in the future.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "66", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "185", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "415", "Review_length": 370}, {"Review ": "Food: I ordered salmon avo roll which was pretty standard!

Izakaya Mew has an impressive menu, with a wide array of dishes you can choose from: seafood carpaccio (yellowtail, salmon, scallop), cooked dishes, udon, ramen, and sushi. Unfortunately, this place does NOT accept reservations, so if you come during peak hours (Thurs/Fri night or the weekend), you will most likely have to wait. If there&#39;s a wait, make sure you put your name down and you&#39;re there when they call your name. Luckily for me, I&#39;ve never had to wait the full estimated wait time; probably due to those impatient folks who put their name down, only to leave 15 minutes later.The sushi is surprisingly good for the price point. My favorite roll has got to be the Mew Special Roll. This is a must order if you like salmon: spicy salmon w/ avocado wrapped with seared salmon... soooo good. I&#39;ve had both the salmon carpaccio and yellowtail carpaccio and enjoyed both very much. Fish quality is quite good for $10 and I like the sauce the fish are topped with.Age Tofu is a must in any Japanese restaurant for me, and I like it here. The dashi (soup base) is so plentiful that it almost looks like tofu soup, but the dashi is delish and not too salty. I also order the Kimchi Cream Udon which is good in small doses - I say that because I&#39;m never able to finish it between 2 people since the creaminess is a tad overbearing after several bites. I recommend this dish full-heartedly, but just split it between 3 people.I&#39;ve seen others order the grilled meats on a stick and they look really good. That along with the Salmon Sashimi Tacos will be my list of things to try next!Cocktails are quite good, albeit pricey at $9, but after a long week of work... you just want to TREAT YOSELF.

Omu Soba is fairly large: a generous serving of noodles underneath well cooked omelet with various sweet sauces. Everything is cooked well, just needed a bit of a kick to bring it all together. Kushi Yaki are several skewers of meat, lightly roasted. All very well made, particularly liked the pork belly and chicken breast. To wash it all down, had the &#34;Frozen Beer&#34; ($7) - a picture worthy beer slushy on top of a pint of Kirin.

We started with the Sashimi and Aburi Salmon Sushi. Both items are really fresh and delicious. They are very close to quality of fish you could get at a $$$ restaurant. A big shout out to the Aburi Salmon Sushi though. The Salmon is half grilled with torch, but it didn&#39;t lessen the fat in the Salmon, rather it enhanced the flavor of it; a dish worth coming back for.As for hot plate, I am quite found of the Kimchi cream udon. They mixed the kimchi flavor with a cheesy cream together to creat a rich and addictive sauce that coats on the udon, but it is overly rich and sticky. 5 stars to that. The only complain that I have is to the Katsu Don. As it is quite a well known dish, I really expected more from them to do a better job. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, it is still nice, but just not up to par. The Katsu itself is too dry and soggy. Even though it is suppose to soak in the broth, it should still be soggy from the outside and a bit crunchy inside. Unfortunately they failed on that part.Dessert is surprisingly good. The green tea creme brle is stunning. It looks very normal, but after you take the first bite you won&#39;t be able to stop then. It is not too sweet, and the greens tea flavor and the crispy sugar top really compensate each other.Definitely recommend it for friends gathering or casual dinner.

Not everything is a rice dish, there&#39;s only one kind of noodle however, glass (see through kind). I noticed there were a few new items today, so I got excited to try it out. For $9 on a HUGE lunch box was pretty promising. Especially when it comes with an extra side. I over estimated myself and couldn&#39;t finish the meal. I got the braised beef chunks platter. It had glass noodles, rice, beef chunks, eggplants, sweet and sour tofu, and an egg on top. The beef was soft, moist and flavorful. The tofu was a firm tofu not the soft kind so gave off a good texture when you bite into it.

I saw that if you checked into Yelp, they would also throw in a free small coffee!At the back of the juice bar, they had a seating area with a few tables. There was also a restroom available which was actually pretty nice. This is a rare thing for New York City, so it felt like a comfortable place for me to hang out at. When the acai bowl and coffee was ready, they called me out, and gave me a tray that I brought back to the seating area.The acai bowl was delicious. It tasted freshly-made, and after my first bite, I was very impressed with the addition of the peanut butter. I have never had peanut butter mixed in with acai before! I have had many acai bowls in my lifetime, but this Purple Evil Minion one was very unique. I would definitely recommend it. The coffee was okay, nothing fancy.Overall, I really liked this place.

I&#39;m thinking at least 10 of each or more. There were also options to get bagel sandwiches. The first time I was there I choose a garlic bagel with regular cream cheese, egg, bacon, and cheddar. The bagel was amazing! It even had bits of garlic on it. Trust me you need to get them toasted.The second time I went I got an onion bagel with garlic cream cheese. Again I was not disappointed.I&#39;m thinking that the sandwich was around $5 and the bagel with spread was around $4. The restaurant was tiny, not a lot of sitting place, yet there is always a full house. The workers are busy yet helpful. I would definitely suggest checking this place out.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "87", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "263", "funnyvote": "2", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "266", "Review_length": 203}, {"Review ": "I see why this place is always crazy busy.

There were not enough tables/chairs for 90% of the people there. I ordered four bagels with plain cream cheese and the total came out to $17. What!?! Why? Because they charge 1.35 for bagels, but for cream cheese, you have to purchase that separately... Depending on the cream cheese, it ranges from $2-$5? Which is crazy! After seeing the total I was like what the heck!? I had high expectations for it. Our order came super fast, because the staff worked really fast.Because of the very limited seating, my family and I had no other options than to go to McDonald&#39;s for seating #sad.Upon arrival at McDonald&#39;s and finding a table really quickly, we took our first bite. We first noticed that the bagel is SUPER doughy, and not in a good way. It tasted undercooked, and I had no idea why people were giving this place 5 stars?!For how pricey these bagels were, I expected it to be better.

Maybe it&#39;s more difficult because of the sheer quantity they have to output everyday, but either way, I&#39;d be willing to come for a breakfast bagel if I were ever inclined to get a quick breakfast to-go.Maybe just as important, this place runs with crazy levels of efficiency, especially during lunchtime.

The layout of the store is a little confusing, as it&#39;s not super clear where you line up to ORDER the bagel, and then where you go to pay for the bagel/order any additional drinks. Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own. I&#39;ve only had it once, maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned enough that one time I had it... or maybe it is supposed to be that way.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "144", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "65", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "100", "Review_length": 430}, {"Review ": "This place reminded me of the soup nazi place Seinfeld.

The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned.

The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema.

The Sicilian wasn&#39;t anything special but the cheese slice hit the spot. I&#39;d go with the normal slices to maximize the sauce to bread and cheese ratio. Normal pricing at about $3-4 per slice. I&#39;ll be going back to check out the rest of their offerings on display.This place had good reviews on Yelp so why not?

My favorite dishes were the coconut curry soup, the fun guy dumplings, the sweet tree roll, the sunny side roll, and the mighty mushroom roll. The food overall was delicious and the ingredients were fresh. They really know how to cook and season vegetables well. The cocktails were surprisingly great as well - really refreshing drinks.

Cool and sleek with grey/silver walls. The washrooms are nice and there are many seating options for large and small parties, as well as seating at the bar. There is also ample space at the front for those waiting for take-out orders, including seating.Since I work near here I&#39;ve already managed to stop by about 10 times - for both takeout and dine in.

The portion is extremely large with broth right up to the brim. Meanwhile there are nowhere near enough noodles etc to match. I think the broth needs to be reduced a lot and the noodles etc increased a little. I didn&#39;t really rate the red miso one I tried or the chili mushroom (not a lot of flavor).

The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited (off peak hours), but it definitely was speedy and attentive service here. The decor was beautiful- clean, simple and spacious. Plenty of seating.The food here is always fresh and made to order. Special attention is given to presentation and plating, making the food look even more appetizing. Sushi rolls here are colorful and unique! Don&#39;t expect your average avocado roll. You would not be able to find plant-based rolls like Beyond Sushi anywhere else.For this visit, I tried the seasonal roll, with Korean sweet potato filling. Really yummy! As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before.

It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m easily persuaded, because The Badge was a delightful appetizer. The dumpling features charred cabbage, onion, garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and sesame oil topped with chili panko, cilantro, and ponzu sauce. The panko gives it some texture, and honestly, you don&#39;t miss the usual pork or crab filling in the center.

My friends and I ordered a variety of sushi.I was originally very skeptical about vegan sushi, but this restaurant definitely changed my views. I tried spicy mang, green machine, sweet tree, and mighty mushroom sushi rolls. All of them were great, but I liked the sweet tree roll the best. It has avocado, sweet potato, and alfalfa sprouts wrapped with six grain rice. I also had the nutty buddy dumplings and they tasted great. The sauce was a bit overpowering, but was still good.

So, sick of doing it yet again I&#39;m going to shorten it.Think this is their first full day open.

A large open front area with space for a Mini Cooper, Register and counter with very pleasant staff. Seating up the side and in the back plus I believe a counter behind the registera area all for maybe 35-45 , didnt count.I ordered the Fun Guy Dumplings (4 to an order): Mushroom, tofu, spinach with micro arugula and a rather nice chili dressing. Mighty Mushroom Roll (8 pcs about 3/4&#34; thick and between a quarter and half dollar in diameter). Shiitake Mushrooms, tofu, enoki, micro arugula, wrapped in a purple 6 grain rice wrap, a little squeeze tube of mushroom teriyaki puree, ginger, wasabi, soy packet. Pickle Me Rolls (similar 8 pcs) carrot, daikon, avocado, squeeze tube of carrot ginger puree.All came within 10-15 minutes topps for just shy of $20. Very tasty, wasabi cleared my sinuses right away.

The flavors weren&#39;t over powering. You get the fennel in the after taste. I didnt really notice the almond pesto. The rice is slightly harder than the traditional.The badge dumplings: i actually like the filling very much. But 2 of my 4 dumplings were not sealed well, so I could just open it up like a taco. The sauce is nicely paired but was heavy handed on my dish.Blackberry lemonade: super disappointed. It was like watered down lemonade.Seating: large dine in area which is unusual for the area. A small bar table by the front window for those here for a quick bite.Def not a place for those with a big appetite. At about $6 avg for a dish, it addes up to be pretty pricy after all is said and done.Overall I would say its not a bad place to grab a healthy snack.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The panini itself was nice and crispy on the outside despite it taking another 30minutes for me to get to work and enjoy it. The tomato, lettuce and prosciutto tasted fresh and the mayo was light. It would make for a filling meal any day.The ice coffee seemed like your regular deli coffee at first but it packs a good caffeine kick in it. And I also appreciate the fact that some of the ice cubes are actually frozen coffee cubes so the coffee doesn&#39;t feel as watered down as the other ice melts.Overall the meal was not &#34;mind-blowing&#34; but it is a good option if you are looking for a regular lunch place near your office with consistently good, healthy options.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "6", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "1", "Review_length": 175}, {"Review ": "For a tiny little joint, this place won&#39;t disappoint !!Great Paninis made with Love.The owner positive and friendly attitude alone is a real pleasure !", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "32", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "62", "Review_length": 25}, {"Review ": "If I could give 0 stars, I would.As if the self portraits on the wall aren&#39;t enough to define this self-absorbed narcissist called Jonny, the service is just as gut wrenching.I have been to JP&#39;s previously and always enjoy my usual panini - #17 caprese, no basil pesto substituted with chimichurri. The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences.

Korean food is my favorite, and the idea of a Korean Chipotle-style restaurant was exciting! I went there finally, and my excitement quickly faded.I went to Purple Rice after work before going to an event and the first thing I noticed was it was quite spacious, which was nice. When I was deciding what to get, the staff kind of just stood there and was not helpful at all. I feel like they didn&#39;t even know anything about Korean food. This was confirmed when I asked for tteok-bokki and they didn&#39;t know what I was asking for, even though it is written on their menu.I ended up ordering kimchi fried rice with crispy chicken, bulgolgi, and tteok-bokki at a cost of $13.00. What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking. Purple Rice is taking advantage of the fact that Koreatown is not that close because if this were near any restaurant there, nobody would ever eat here.

If there were half stars, I would probably give this a 4.5, since there are some Korean spots where I like the food better, but rounding up instead of down because there isn&#39;t a lot of affordable and customizable Korean fast casual in the city. I like that this fills that niche.For our first visit, the bowl seemed like the best option. For $9.95 pre-tax, you get a base plus 2 toppings. The base could be white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, or japchae. Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got. Pretty happy with the choices.I would definitely go back to Purple Rice to try more of the entrees and options.

I&#39;ve been wanting to come to this place since it opened up and finally had a chance to last night. Interior is really clean and actually very large - there&#39;s a ton of seating and also easy to takeout.The menu is simple - you can choose a box (~$13) or a bowl (~$10). Boxes are a base plus three entrees and bowls are base plus two entrees. The base consists of white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, and japchae (sweet potato noodles). Entrees are varied - there&#39;s pork, chicken, tofu, rice cakes, etc.I ordered japchae base bowl with spicy pork and dukbokki (spicy rice cake) and got a small side of kimchi jiggae soup (~$5). Everything was really good. The spicy pork was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The dukbokki was a little sweet, but delicious - spicy, soft. The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow! K town kimchi jiggae can be up to $15 (the tax and tip when you sit down), but as Purple Rice is a grab and go, for $5 small or $10 large - it&#39;s perfect price and better quality. The manager last night said that it takes about 2 weeks to make their kimchi in-house. The soup is authentic and it&#39;s worth a try.

I associate Korean food with a lot of flavor, and this was sort of lacking. The veggies were mostly potatoes with some carrots, onions and zucchini. They were seasoned well but nothing revolutionary.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar).

I came by around early evening and was surprised how many baked goods they still had in stock (however, on another night, this wasn&#39;t the case).Anyways, I wasn&#39;t in the mood for overly sweet things so I ended up getting the apple cider cake donut which sounded different, but not over the top crazy like some of the other cool sounding flavors here. I also considered the cinnamon snail, but it looked too sweet for my tastes at the time.I didn&#39;t think someone could mess up a cake donut, until now. It definitely tasted a couple days old because it was really dried out. Maybe the summer heat got to it despite being indoors?

It&#39;s an ancho chili seitan burger grilled in maple hickory bbq sauce with jalapeno mac n cheese, arugula, smoked chili coconut bacon &amp; chipotle mayo on a grilled pretzel bun. I ordered mine on a bed of quinoa and greens instead of the bun,mostly because I didn&#39;t want each bite to be a mess. Sometimes, forks are better. This burger truly was the best of it all thanks to the dollop of jalapeno mac n&#39; cheese. So delish! I would definitely recommend this.I had hoped to have room left for a doughnut or some other baked delectable, but it didn&#39;t work out that way. The serving was huge.

It was everything I anticipated, and then some.The Cinnamon Snail is located inside of the Pennsy, which offers a collection of order-at-counter shops. Everything from meats, seafood, a bar, etc. Cinnamon Snail is the only full-vegan shop inside of the Pennsy. You order and then sit inside the shared space within the Pennsy, almost like a high-end cafeteria. As a vegan dating a non-vegan, we really valued this set up since we each got to get the food we preferred, but still sit and eat together. The interior was aesthetically pleasing, lit up with beautiful natural lighting.The servers at the counter of the cinnamon snail were very friendly and welcoming. They were attentive to my questions and answered appropriately.I ordered the beast mode burger and the raspberry cheesecake donut. The food menu is minimal, so I had a somewhat easy time choosing the burger. But the sweets selection is so extensive that I had a difficult time just choosing one item. I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for. The pretzel bun took everything to another level.Prices were on the higher end ($11.02 burger, $3.50 donut) but I suppose I can justify it with 1) The burger was soo filling and 2) artisanal donut. I guess it depends on who you&#39;re asking.My only gripe maybe would be the wait time, but since I arrived right at opening, I didn&#39;t face that issue. But after sitting and observing the line for an hour, The Cinnamon Snail was constantly the longest line inside of the Pennsy.

The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called).

The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4.

The layout of the store is a little confusing, as it&#39;s not super clear where you line up to ORDER the bagel, and then where you go to pay for the bagel/order any additional drinks. Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place! Even on a Tuesday morning, there was frequent customers coming in to grab their bagels and the store was definitely bustling.

When I opened the lid of the takeout container, the hypnotic aroma of truffle oil washed over me, and I knew that I was really going to enjoy this. I fought through my fear of burning my tongue so I could devour this cassone, which is a testament to how good it smelled. It was totally worth it.

The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said &#34;i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?&#34; So I deconstructed a piece of the second half. There was a small amount of chicken, but it looked shredded, just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn&#39;t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich.This place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner.

Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own. I&#39;ve only had it once, maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned enough that one time I had it... or maybe it is supposed to be that way.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "144", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "65", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "100", "Review_length": 430}, {"Review ": "This place reminded me of the soup nazi place Seinfeld.

The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema. Come by the next time you have something to do in Penn, or MSG.The last time I came here, there seemed to be a card minimum, but I think it has since been dropped?

This is the quintessential NY slice that you have to give your friends, your family, your distant cousins from Kentucky who think they know what pizza is, your friends from afar who have underestimate American ingenuity, and even that homeless guy you want to help out cause everyone should have this pizza.Their staff is friendly and quick! I was lucky enough that they gave me an extra free slice of plain to make way for a new fresh pie. That&#39;s how fresh their pizza is. Their sauce is less acidic than typical marinara but not too sweet like many canned sauces. The crust is durable and withstands the fold test like a champ. No drooping. No sag.

I perused the menu on my last visit and it sounded like they had some excellent stuff on there.My favorite items on the menu are as follows:- all the dumplings, but The Badge in particular- the nutty buddy rice paper wrap- the coconut curry soup- the spicy mang sushi rollI&#39;d have to say that I don&#39;t really rate the ramen/noodle soups on the menu - I think that item still needs perfecting. The portion is extremely large with broth right up to the brim. Meanwhile there are nowhere near enough noodles etc to match. I think the broth needs to be reduced a lot and the noodles etc increased a little. I didn&#39;t really rate the red miso one I tried or the chili mushroom (not a lot of flavor). Also, I didn&#39;t find the chili mushroom that spicy despite numerous warnings from staff.Thanks again Beyond Sushi.

It is a full service, sit down location, in addition to take out. Beyond Sushi&#39;s 100% vegan menu has really expanded since they first started, and it&#39;s all amazing! The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited (off peak hours), but it definitely was speedy and attentive service here. The decor was beautiful- clean, simple and spacious. Plenty of seating.The food here is always fresh and made to order. Special attention is given to presentation and plating, making the food look even more appetizing. Sushi rolls here are colorful and unique! Don&#39;t expect your average avocado roll. You would not be able to find plant-based rolls like Beyond Sushi anywhere else.For this visit, I tried the seasonal roll, with Korean sweet potato filling. Really yummy! As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before. They are not trying to imitate meat/ fish, but trying to highlight PLANT foods. Prices are reasonable, especially for vegan food.

It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m easily persuaded, because The Badge was a delightful appetizer. The dumpling features charred cabbage, onion, garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and sesame oil topped with chili panko, cilantro, and ponzu sauce.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day).

When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences. They took them down due to these threats, so don&#39;t be fooled by the 5 star reviews.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "17", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "24", "Friendcount": "5", "funnyvote": "9", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 665}, {"Review ": "The paninis here are exactly what they&#39;re like in Italy.

What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking.

Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got. Pretty happy with the choices.I would definitely go back to Purple Rice to try more of the entrees and options. Really great having such a convenient fast casual spot like this when you don&#39;t feel like having a full meal in K-Town.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "77", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "4", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "135", "Review_length": 269}, {"Review ": "It&#39;s a great new lunch/dinner spot in midtown! I&#39;ve been wanting to come to this place since it opened up and finally had a chance to last night. Interior is really clean and actually very large - there&#39;s a ton of seating and also easy to takeout.The menu is simple - you can choose a box (~$13) or a bowl (~$10). Boxes are a base plus three entrees and bowls are base plus two entrees. The base consists of white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, and japchae (sweet potato noodles). Entrees are varied - there&#39;s pork, chicken, tofu, rice cakes, etc.I ordered japchae base bowl with spicy pork and dukbokki (spicy rice cake) and got a small side of kimchi jiggae soup (~$5). Everything was really good. The spicy pork was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The dukbokki was a little sweet, but delicious - spicy, soft. The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow! K town kimchi jiggae can be up to $15 (the tax and tip when you sit down), but as Purple Rice is a grab and go, for $5 small or $10 large - it&#39;s perfect price and better quality. The manager last night said that it takes about 2 weeks to make their kimchi in-house. The soup is authentic and it&#39;s worth a try. It&#39;s a little salty, so make sure you get a side of rice for it.I&#39;m definitely coming back.

The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar). The blackberry fig one was like an extremely tough, dense piece of bread with an admittedly tasty glaze (could definitely taste the fig!). Even split between two people we only managed a few bites.

It was everything I anticipated, and then some.The Cinnamon Snail is located inside of the Pennsy, which offers a collection of order-at-counter shops. Everything from meats, seafood, a bar, etc. Cinnamon Snail is the only full-vegan shop inside of the Pennsy. You order and then sit inside the shared space within the Pennsy, almost like a high-end cafeteria. As a vegan dating a non-vegan, we really valued this set up since we each got to get the food we preferred, but still sit and eat together. The interior was aesthetically pleasing, lit up with beautiful natural lighting.The servers at the counter of the cinnamon snail were very friendly and welcoming. They were attentive to my questions and answered appropriately.I ordered the beast mode burger and the raspberry cheesecake donut. The food menu is minimal, so I had a somewhat easy time choosing the burger. But the sweets selection is so extensive that I had a difficult time just choosing one item. I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for. The pretzel bun took everything to another level.Prices were on the higher end ($11.02 burger, $3.50 donut) but I suppose I can justify it with 1) The burger was soo filling and 2) artisanal donut.

The frosting on top solidified, but the donut itself was still really soft. I really liked the Raspberry and Chocolate combo - they go really well together. The Maple Smoked Almond was flaky and had a different texture than the Raspberry Blackout. It was more thick, dry, and relatively small in size compared to the other two. The Lemon donut was pretty good. It was more like the Raspberry Blackout in texture.

I liked it because it wasn&#39;t pretending to be near, but was still satisfying to eat, with the sort of cinnamony sweetness that was subtle enough to be enjoyable. The jalapeo mac and cheese on top made for a really weird mouthfeel and great taste. Too subtle on the bacon replacement, didn&#39;t really notice it, but it did no harm. The pretzel bun was tasty but dry. Vegan baked goods looked good so we grabbed the &#34;chocolate peanut butter cookie doughnut&#34; because those are the most beautiful words in the English language - dry and heavy but the ganache was good, wouldve liked less cake to the doughnut because it wasn&#39;t too dry with the center ganache on it.We grabbed a cider from the bar while we waited outside on a nice LDW Saturday.

The chocolate glaze on the donut was crumbly and the almonds on the marble almond bacon bacon tasted burnt.The reason it didn&#39;t receive a 5 star for me is because 1) even though there was only one person behind me, I felt very rushed when I was ordering and 2) all the donuts were different sizes.

Only giving it two stars because the employees are very nice. Did not enjoy the taste of the products or the pricing of them .I&#39;ll start with some positives:1. The workers are kind and very genuine2. There is free wifi3. There are a lot of seats and tables here, and with the wifi, you can potentially do some work here if you wanted to.On the flip side,1. The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called). It literally tasted like protein and it was VERY starchy. No sweetness and felt as though it wasn&#39;t complete. For $10, I expected a lot more.2. My friend ordered a coffee smoothie and had a similar problem with mine. I tried his, and also thought it tasted terrible.3. I ordered the ginger cayenne lemon shots as well. I was so excited because a lot of restaurant don&#39;t add the cayenne. What seemed like a lot of potential, ended up being a shot that might have been better with only ginger. The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4. It took a little over 20 minutes to get my order, which for a pretty empty juice place, seemed kind of long.Overall, not a fan of the smoothies, the ginger shot, or the price.

Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this.

Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

Highly recommended for a quick sandwich on the go whether you&#39;re jumping on the train or a bus. There are three small stools along the wall if you decide to eat inside. Go for the Cassoni - a delightful cheesy pocket sandwich with a wide array of meat options.The menu is split between Piadine (open sandwich), Cassoni (pocket sandwich), and Piadizze (small pizzas). We tried the Siciliano Cassoni and the Diavola Piadine. Both were very good, though I enjoyed the cheesy pocket of the cassoni more given the greasiness of Diavola. The Siciliano was a combination of eggplant, ham and cheese melted together and enclosed in a flaky crust to make a perfect sandwich.

We were surprised by how small it was! there&#39;s virtually no seating space, so be prepared to either eat your food elsewhere. That being said, the inside of the place is very cute!Our cashier was amazingly friendly. She found out that it was our first time eating here, and quickly explained the different types of foods they prepare. I ended up ordering the Piemontese Cassone, and my boyfriend got the Newyorkese Piada. They came out pretty quickly, and they were piping hot! I actually had to wait about 10 minutes until mine was cool enough, but I&#39;m kind of wimpy when it comes to temperature.The Newyorkese Piada was really yummy! All the ingredients tasted really fresh, and the consistency of the bread was nice.Now, I take my truffles seriously, and the Piemontese Cassone really knocked my socks off. When I opened the lid of the takeout container, the hypnotic aroma of truffle oil washed over me, and I knew that I was really going to enjoy this. I fought through my fear of burning my tongue so I could devour this cassone, which is a testament to how good it smelled. It was totally worth it. You really can&#39;t go wrong with truffle oil, mozzarella, and sausage. There are so many other interesting things on the menu, but I&#39;m so in love with this cassone that I wouldn&#39;t mind only getting this when I come back to Non Solo Piada.One thing to note is that the portions aren&#39;t big!

This place makes everything on a type of flat breadAfter staring at the menu, I ordered the Margherita which is Roman plum tomatoes, mozzarella, pomodoro sauce, and basil in &#34;pizza&#34; form. So when you are a lover of New York and New Haven style pizzas, and you order what looks like it should be a pizza, then getting served &#34;pizza&#34; on a flatbread is a little disappointing. Had this been explained before I placed the order, I probably would have gotten a different flavor. The woman tells us what it is well after the order is placed and she heard my friend saying that she didn&#39;t want to eat anything from there since she didn&#39;t know what any of it was.The flatbread was made to order, and it had a nice fresh flavor. It&#39;s something that I would get again if I were on a diet and didn&#39;t want the guilt of eating regular pizza.The Americano was like a flat bread sandwich. It had grilled chicken, mozzarella, and roasted peppers. All I could taste was the cheese. The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said &#34;i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?&#34; So I deconstructed a piece of the second half. There was a small amount of chicken, but it looked shredded, just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn&#39;t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich.This place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner.

First trip to the big apple and my girlfriend and I were looking for a quick lunch before we go on a trip to the financial district. The pictures on yelp instantly got me, so we decided to check it out. I got a pizza with baby arugula and prosciutto...from the first bite I knew I found a new home in New York. The crust was paper thin and the sauce was marvelous..so good we had to come twice in a span of 3 days. My girlfriend had a calzone with pancetta chicken and of course mozzarella. It had a little secret ingredient added in there as well some Oregano just to give it that perfect taste for taste buds to go insane. The service was amazing as well the girl at the cashier was very nice and attentive. For a small place in the city I got exactly what I was looking for, a little whole in the wall with lots of love and flavor.

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own.

Some other well known pizza places only allow you to commit to a whole pie, so we loved the option here. You have about 24+ kinds of pizza to choose from by the slice. It&#39;s amazing to be able to try all kinds of variations. I opted for a slice of mushroom, and my husband had a slice of the grandma&#39;s and the suprema.

I&#39;ve also come to the realization that I was much too harsh in my initial review.The first thing about this place is that you need to know what to order. The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema. Come by the next time you have something to do in Penn, or MSG.The last time I came here, there seemed to be a card minimum, but I think it has since been dropped?

It is a full service, sit down location, in addition to take out. Beyond Sushi&#39;s 100% vegan menu has really expanded since they first started, and it&#39;s all amazing! The service here was great. Super friendly host/ waitress, and the food came out really quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited (off peak hours), but it definitely was speedy and attentive service here. The decor was beautiful- clean, simple and spacious. Plenty of seating.The food here is always fresh and made to order. Special attention is given to presentation and plating, making the food look even more appetizing. Sushi rolls here are colorful and unique! Don&#39;t expect your average avocado roll. You would not be able to find plant-based rolls like Beyond Sushi anywhere else.For this visit, I tried the seasonal roll, with Korean sweet potato filling. Really yummy! As usual, all the flavors blend together seamlessly. I&#39;ve tried many rolls from Beyond Sushi and the flavors are always great.For the non sushi items, the Fun Guy mushroom dumplings are delicious! The filling melts in your mouth and is bursting with umami flavor. I would say the other dumplings are not as good as the mushroom one. I have not tried the noodles or salad at this location yet, so I will refrain from commenting for now.I got a side of house made Kimchi- it was alright. Probably would not get it again. They added gochujang which is kinda weird to put IN the kimchi itself? So it was more sweet than tangy.Basically most of the food here is Asian Fusion style, not traditionally Japanese. Tons of flavor and unique combinations- check out the menu online! It is a very interesting experience for your palate if you&#39;ve never had vegan sushi before. They are not trying to imitate meat/ fish, but trying to highlight PLANT foods. Prices are reasonable, especially for vegan food. There are lunchtime combos (e.g. sushi roll + dumpling, or sushi roll + salad).

You could fit a Uniqlo inside here. It&#39;s absolutely massive. A huge step for the team, and soon, this latest restaurant will begin to serve beer, sake, and sake cocktails as well. But that&#39;s still a ways out as they continue to push papers with local government officials. For now, come simply to enjoy art in vegetable-based sushi form.I&#39;ve had many of their rolls over the years, but it was suggested I give their steamed dumplings a try. It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m easily persuaded, because The Badge was a delightful appetizer. The dumpling features charred cabbage, onion, garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and sesame oil topped with chili panko, cilantro, and ponzu sauce. The panko gives it some texture, and honestly, you don&#39;t miss the usual pork or crab filling in the center. It&#39;s its own thing, and it&#39;s delicious.If you can&#39;t decide on what roll you&#39;d like, opt for the four-piece sampler where you&#39;ll get to try a smattering of the following rolls:Charred corn with harrisa and cilantroCurried cauliflower with almond pestoRoasted tomato with tomato guajilloSeaweed salad with chili flakes and sesame seedsIt circles the wagons on taste profile and uniqueness, and it&#39;s a good way to try many different flavors without breaking the bank (or elasticity in your stomach). The roasted tomato roll might be my least favorite of the grouping, but you&#39;ll hardly notice since everything else is so satisfying.For the first time, you can actually bring a huge group to a Beyond Sushi. 70% of their clientele isn&#39;t vegan, but rather fans of delicious food.

The panini had a satisfying crunch to it, and overall sandwich was fantastic.To get to the full groupon amount ($20), I also got a whole wheat croissant with jelly (awesome and almost guilt-free!) and a pistachio-creme croissant (wonderful). To be honest, I actually left without the pistachio croissant and noticed the missing item when I got back to my place in LIC.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "I dropped by today to pick up a panini before work.First please note that they no longer accept Groupons, apparently Groupon ran a promotion without their permission.

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences.

To top it all off, the aioli was super tasty and all the flavors combined for a nice bite.With each sandwich you get a bag of chips--which I didn&#39;t even need since the sandwich was so filling--and it only came out to around $10, so not a bad deal for lunch in HK.If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, definitely check this place out.

What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking.

The base could be white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, or japchae. Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got.

There was also a VERY loud banging noise upstairs, which is obviously not the restaurant&#39;s fault, but that didn&#39;t add to the ambiance, and was distracting enough that I thought I&#39;d mention it.Underwhelming, but I wouldn&#39;t totally discount it, maybe other dishes are more exciting.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "115", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "102", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "38", "Review_length": 219}, {"Review ": "My new favorite lunch place near Penn Station.

The baristas have found a way to brew coffee such that it does its job (wake you up) without leaving you with the usual aftertaste one gets from mediocre brews.The cozy patina may at first seem cramped or small, but how much better it is than a dozen desks full of people working or in meetings. The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication. And of course, they make awesome coffee.--Overall, ALT is an genuine coffee shop. It does not concern itself with being a coworking space that serves coffee or a faux-vintage caffeine dispenser.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar). The blackberry fig one was like an extremely tough, dense piece of bread with an admittedly tasty glaze (could definitely taste the fig!). Even split between two people we only managed a few bites.

I was sad to find this out after I arrived, but fortunately the Cinnamon Snail had their truck set up outside.Decided to get the Tofu Burger (with gluten free bread) and a Peanut Butter Blondie. The total came to about $18 which was partially expected. I was excited to try the burger since it seemed quite good, but was overall very disappointed. The tofu was extremely bland (not sure if it was even marinated) despite being extremely saucy. My sandwich was dripping sauce, but it tasted not much more than a block of tofu with some light creamy/oily sauce that lacked salt. The sandwich fell far below my expectations so I moved onto my dessert. Upon taking it out of the bag, it started crumbling to pieces (which makes somewhat sense because it&#39;s gluten free). It was very little for what&#39;s it&#39;s worth. I liked the fact that it wasn&#39;t overly sweet, but it was pretty average in taste.Overall, my experience would&#39;ve been a 1 star review. The only reason I gave 2 was because the service was quick (maybe a reason as to why my sandwich was sad) and the cashier was kind.", "Ratings": 2.0, "Reviewcount": "51", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "80", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "49", "Review_length": 226}, {"Review ": "Got a delectable miso teriyaki burger last night at The Pennsy location of The Cinnamon Snail.
